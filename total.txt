I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip. Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it. Personally, I enjoy looking at and learning about new inventions and all the science. That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea. However, my class and I have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show. We are attracted to this show and would like to go. Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum.###I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip.

According to the day's programme, we are visiting the Science Museum in the morning and we are going shopping in the afternoon. My suggestion is to use Wednesday's afternoon free time as an alternative solution of the shopping. This way we will be able to visit the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday evening, and see the show.###According to the day's programme, we are visiting the Science Museum in the morning and we are going shopping in the afternoon.

I'm a student in an English class which is going to spend three days in London (13th-14th March) and I'm a representative student from my class  to thanks you about your programme that you've already organised for us. It's really wonderful, especially the River trip to Greenwich. We feel we can't wait until that time.###I'm a student in an English class which is going to spend three days in London (13th-14th March) and I'm the student representative from my class  to thank you for the programme that you've already organised for us.

However, the students in my class, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which will be on 14th March between 10.00 to 19.00 at the Central Exhibition Hall, London. The show has many interesting parts such as the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and Hairstyles and we are all agreed that it's a great opportunity for us because most of us are going to study on a Fashion and Design course in next term and the other students are also interesting in new fashion. So we think that it will be useful for all of us.###However, the students in my class, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which will be on 14th March between 10.00 to 19.00 at the Central Exhibition Hall, London.

Anyway, we still want to go to the Science Museum and shopping as well but we think we can go shopping on the last day afternoon of our trip. So we will have some free time on the afternoon of the 14th March and we can spend this time enjoy the show. I'm also include the show's leaflet on the back of this letter.

I believe that everyone in this world have curiosity. We're always want to know about others' life, especially the famous - one even the one that we hate. But we have to accept that everyone has their private life for example, when we get married or when a policeman stop us on the highway, we don't want any stranger notice that what is happening to us.###I believe that everyone in this world has curiosity.

Famous people are also the normal people like us just because their jobs are known by every people, it doesn't mean that we can invade their privacy. They also want to have some special time with their family or their friends. It's not fair for them to have journalists following them and take their photographs, and some journalists write the news that are not true. We also can't deny that the journalists' job is to know what's going on with these famous people.

In the next few years the people's home will be changes a lot. First point is we will use more often new technologies like telecommunication or the internet. In the future they both getting closer and closer. That means for exampel, while you are sitting in the office you are able to controll your home with the computer. You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off. Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk, eggs or chees. Or, never living the office, you are able to heat the wather for a hot bath. So in fact people's home became more confienence and comfortabler. I think also housewifes will receive more help with a robotor in the household. But the form and the rooms of a building will still be the same. And of course the furnitures of people's home will not change as well.###In the next few years the people's homes will be changing a lot.

My friend and I had just arrived at a small airport in the middle of the Californian desert. One man came out from a small building. It was our pilot. He introduced himself and we walked towards a small plane. The doors of the plane were so thin, that I thought I could torne them. We went inside and the plane took off. It was horrible. I could feel every movement which was caused by clowds or winds. I thought we would die.###My friend and I had just arrived at a small airport in the middle of the Californian desert.

What we are suggesting you is to change the programme on the afternoon of March the 14th. Instead of going shopping, we could go to the show.

Those movie stars or politicians may have a lot of money, may do whatever they want but what is the price to pay? Would you like to live a life like that, every time you make a wrong step, the whole world is looking at you, judging you. It must be very exhausted to have the medias around you days and nights because you can't be yourself, you have to show your best side and character.###Those movie stars or politicians may have a lot of money, may do whatever they want but what is the price to pay?

I get up very early. All the city was sleeping. The weather was cold. When I arrived in front of the bank, my heart was going faster.

The other reason as I mention earlier is because of a request off all the class. We've seen an advertisement in the newspapers, about a Fashion exhibition in London on Tuesday the 14 of March. That is one of the 3 days that we will spent in London as a college. So we had this great idea, if it is possible of course, we could to include this exhibition in our programme.###The other reason as I mentioned earlier is because of a request of the whole class.

It was a horrible day, the day I had left my key at home! There was nobody to let me in, noway to contact with my parents. What I decided to do was getting into the house by climbing up the roof because I knew one of the windows was unlocked. First, I climbed the tree in the garden. It was okay, beause I was quite good at that, but the problem was that I had to jump onto the roof! It had been raining, the previous day, so the roof was slippy! I managed to do that although I cut my knee! I walked on the roof carefully, so as not to slip. I was extremely happy when I got into the house.

I guess there will be more gadget to do some housework easier. Maybe there will be some robots to do our ironings, washing our dishes, cleaning everywhere, hoovering, etc. Will it make life easier?

Now IT (information technology) is in our life. We can get everything we want to know from computers. It means we won't need to go somewhere to get some information we need.

Probably our homes will be smaller than now. Because the human population is growing quickly and people prefer to stay in big cities (like London, New York, Paris). It means there will be too many people in small areas. Then there will have been built smaller houses, flats, buildings, etc. Outside big cities there won't be any people at all.

We think it is a great opportunity because it only takes place once a year and it is free for students. We would suggest replacing the shopping trip on Tuesday afternoon with the visit to the show. We think we would all have another chance for shopping in London sometime later.
Please think about our suggestion and the proposed change of the programme. We are sure this is suitable to all of us. Thank you very much.###Please think about our suggestion and the proposed change to the programme. We are sure this is suitable for all of us. Thank you very much.
The view from outside will mainly be the same. The houses will look like the houses of today. A simple and well-proofen architecture. The difference will be inside the buildings. The doors would be the entrance to another world....###The view from outside will mainly be the same. The houses will look like the houses of today. A simple and well-proven architecture.

The fridge, the television, the stove and the Hi-Fi equipment will be attached to a computer network. Every electronic gadget in the futur home will be able to comunicate with other machines or computers. It will be possible to connect to the Internet from nearly everywhere in the house or flat. I'm sure all the things which are based on electronic parts will totally change. Also the aspects of security within people's homes.###The fridge, the television, the stove and the hi-fi equipment will be attached to a computer network.

I would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see: It is "The London Fashion and Leisure Show", which is going to take place at the "Central Exibition Hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th March, between 10.00 and 19.00. The latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles will be shown in this occasion.

The path we were walking in was quite clean and I was feeling really happy and relaxed... until we reached a river. There were nor a bridge nor a canoe, the only way to cross it was by walking on an old big tree trunk which was lying down, peacefully, making the only connection between our side and the other.###The path we were walking on was quite clean and I was feeling really happy and relaxed... until we reached a river.

My mother and brothers had already crossed the river, and they were encouraging me to do the same from the other side of it, but I was paralysed with fear. Then, I suddenly realised that I had no choice, so I took all my courage, took a big deep breath, and crossed it! It was easier than I had thought!. That day, I learnt that I can do even things which, at first sight, seem impossible to be done.###My mother and brothers had already crossed the river, and they were encouraging me to do the same from the other side of it, but I was paralysed with fear.

According to your advertisement, we were pleased to learn that we can do some different activities in London, which included in sightseeing by bus, a River trip to Greenwich, visiting the Science Museum and National Art Gallery and so on. The point is, The London Fashion and Leisure show will be fantastic. From these we can see the latest fashion, imagintive make up and hairstyles. What is more they are the Leisure and sports wear, which we are keen on seeing it. In your advertisement, you had written "The show will be help in the Central Exhibition hall in London, it starts from 10 am to 7 pm on 14th March."###Concerning your advertisement, we were pleased to learn that we can do some different activities in London, which include in sightseeing by bus, a River trip to Greenwich, visiting the Science Museum and National Art Gallery and so on.

I think it is a great opportunity because I am sure we will enjoy ourselves. But I wonder if the timetable could change, which will be perfect. As you know, all of us want to join the programme, so if some students go to the Science Museum, they will miss the wonderful show. For that reason, I suggest that you could change the activities. In my opinion, we had better go to the show instead of the science museum and shopping, also we can go to the Science Museum on 15th March, which instead of the free time in the afternoon.###I think it is a great opportunity because I am sure we will enjoy ourselves.

So I must find out a solution which can help my great father. One day, I suddenly got a good idea. 'Why not go to the sock exchange?' I said to myself. Almost every day I stayed in there and research the exchange decline-line, which give me lots of information from there. Finally, I decide to join in the dangerous game, which will lost everything or suddenly become a millionaire. With luck, I was won by chance.###So I must find out a way which to help my great father.

In my opinion, each human being has a rights to be free. We can go for a wolk, go shopping, go to the cinema, get marrige or devorce. Why famous people couldn't do all this things? Why everybody must know and tolk about their private life? The most important thing is that the famous people are also normal people as us. They live as us, they brief and eat as us, they even following in love as us. I think, they must have a normal, private life without journalists following them all the time and without any exact details about them appearing in the different newspaper's curiouses.###In my opinion, each human being has a right to be free.

We discussed the programme. It would be great to take a trip to Greenwich by boat. We all would love to do it. However, we have seen an advertisement about "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" recently. It will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th March at 10 a.m to 7 p.m.. According to an advertisement, a lot of events will take place during the show such as make up, hairstyles, latest fashions and leisure and sports wear. It would be a golden opportunity to know up-to-date fashion. In addition, it is free for students.###We discussed the programme. It would be great to take a trip to Greenwich by boat.

Some people are in favour of covering famous people's in-depth stories. Because it is interesting and they can forget about their own problems by imagining celebrities' luxurious lives. Moreover, they think that celebrities do not have to hide from publicity because it means that they are extremely popular with people and being loved.###Some people are in favour of covering famous people's stories in depth, because it is interesting and they can forget about their own problems by imagining celebrities' luxurious lives.

On the other hand, other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment. They claim that it is absolutely an intrusion on the privacy. What is more, they insist that before celebrities, they are also human-beings who want to live without being disturbed and watched.###On the other hand, other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment.

In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages of covering celebrities. Taking everything into account, the drawbacks far outweigh its benefits. Thus, I think that journalists should consider celebrities' lives and be in celebrities' shoes. ###In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to covering celebrities.

We know, that you wanted to have another  and didn't know which one. If we go to the show, we will see many hairstyles. Maybe it'll help you choose. Also, you'll be glad to know, that for students it is free! So, we think, that it is very good as for you as for us.###We know, that you want to have another  and don't know which one.

On Tuesday morning we go to the show and after that shopping. And on Wednesday morning we go to the national art gallery, but after that we can go to the Science Museum, in the afternoon.###So, we can change your programme a little bit to the best one.

It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. My best friend told me, she met one boy. She liked him very much. She was speaking about him every time.

I belived everything she has told me. And said just to be careful. But in three days she hasn't been at home. She disappeared! We called the police. They advised us to wait.

Someone told me if I wanted to see my friend, I must take 5000$ and bring them up to the street. I took any papers, put them to one bag and without saying anything went to my friend to take something that looked like a gun. The friend gave me his toy gun and I gone to the street. There I saw a man and my friend. I showed the man, that I had a gun and money. I was surprised that he belived me. Of course, it was better for us.

A few days ago, we saw an advertisement about "The London Fashion and Leisure Show", which seems to be very attractive.

What do you think about our jobs? It would be all the more interesting for us as fashion is a great interest for people from our age. Moreover, you wouldn't have to worry about the price as it is free for the students. If you agree, we will only have to change the programme on Tuesday afternoon: I mean that instead of shopping, we would go to this exhibition. But I guess that neither us nor you would be against the sacrifice of a "Shopping-Afternoon" - that we can even put on Wednesday during the free-time - so that we are able to enjoy the Fashion and Leisure Show...###What do you think about our jobs?

The respect of Famous people's private life has always been a hot topic... On the one hand, those people are equal to us in the way that they had a childhood, thy got married and built a family... The only difference between them and us is the kind of job they are doing, which is literally a "public job". Therefore, why do we have to talk and gossip about them?! But on the other hand, the aim of a "public job", such as politician or actor, is to be known and appreciated by the population. And here comes the paradox: Do we have to reveal someone's privacy to judge his work and appreciate him? Well, some people would agree whereas others would desagree. I guess this is an unanswerable question...###The respect of Famous people's private lives has always been a hot topic...

As far as I'm concerned, I would say that famous people made the choice to be followed and tracked by journalists all the time, when they chose to be famous. That's as simple as this! Everyone is aware of the celebrity's consequences so, if they really wanted their privacy, why did they choose a "public job"?? Even if anyone deserve to have a private life, famous people know and might have made a mistake... However, I would add that journalists - being aware of that hard topic - should try to modorate what they write in order to respect altrui's privacy; since they would probably not be glad to have their own private life revealed!###As far as I'm concerned, I would say that famous people made the decision to be followed and tracked by journalists all the time, when they chose to be famous.

We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. and we would all like to go to this show. It would be very special for us because we haven't seen something like that before. There are four different shows.

I have further ideas: In the futur, maybe in 2113, there will are houses like now but only with more technical things.

First of all, we want to say thanks to you because we know the effort you have done organising our good programme, but we would really like to go to the London fashion and leisure show we saw in the advertisement. We think that perhaps in Tuesday March 14, we could change the time of going to the Science Museum, and (we) go earlier to the Museum, such as half past eight on the morning, so we could go after, at ten o'clock, to the show, and we could also delay going shopping on that afternoon, because the show lasts til seven o'clock on the evening. And we have thought that we could go shopping the next day, because we do not have nothing to do on that afternoon.###First of all, we want to say thanks to you because we know the effort you have made organising this excellent programme, but we would really like to go to the London fashion and leisure show we saw in the advertisement.

In the future, our homes will have the most advanced technologies.

Although computers will give us all the material things, it could not give us things like the feeling of being in your home, have, etc. That things won't change in our home.

I thing that the journalit's only aim is money, be cause they know that if they publish famous people's private life they would earn lot's of money selling the magazine or the newspaper.

We've just been told about your programme and I must say that we all like it! What I am most looking forward to, is the River trip to Greenwich; but I would also really like to visit the Science Museum as well as the National Gallery! This will be very enriching for us! You must wonder why I'm writing to you, them! ... well actually we've must received an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and the vast majority of the class would like to go and see it. This will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March. We thought it would be a great experience for us since we quite don't have such opportunities in our everyday life! Moreover, the entrance is free for the students so that won't raise the cost for the trip. I thought we should visit the Science Museum on Monday afternoon so that we could do the River trip on Tuesday morning just before going to the fashion show! Anyway, we were to go shopping on Tuesday afternoon so that won't be a problem to my mind!###We've just been told about your programme and I must say that we all like it!

George was leaning on the floor, surrounded by his own lake of blood. He had just been beaten by a ground of white men. And yet, he was too weak to resist the rats, coming from everywhere and eating his face, his legs and his arms, waiting with great impatience for his death.###George was lying on the floor, surrounded by his own lake of blood.

He had been chained and no way could he escape from his fate without some help! The place where I was hidden was overlooking the house where he was kept prisonner. No one was garding him.

Could I suggest that you consider changing the programme? The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to take place on 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall in London. According to the advertisement I have seen, it is supposed to show the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It is also free to enter for students.###Could I suggest that you consider changing the programme?

It might be a good idea to fit this visit in in the afternoon on 14th March because I strongly believe that it would stimulate our interests in London so that we could study English with strongest motivation. Even if we do not have enough time for shopping after the show, we will be able to go shopping at a free time on 15th March.###It might be a good idea to fit this visit in in the afternoon on 14th March because I strongly believe that it would stimulate our interests in London so that we could study English with greatest motivation.

Secondly, noone has the right to look at anyone's private life even if they are journalists.

We tend to think that famous people, such as politicians and film stars, are very happy and satisfied with their life. But such an attitude is wrong. It is quite obvious, that celebreties can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, what makes their life miserable.###We tend to think that famous people, such as politicians and film stars, are very happy and satisfied with their life.

The politicians and film stars also want to have a normal life after work. They want to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. Although, their news on the front page of a magazine can catch the eyes of the public so that people will never forget them. On the other hand, their story always make them embarras because most of the journalists create their own story base on the true story just to get the attraction from people.###Politicians and film stars also want to have a normal life after work.

Famous People x the Media###Famous People & the Media
Famous people are special for the rest of the society. They form opinions and invent new fashion styles. Nowadays, the media is expanding its ways of communication so they need more information.

It's important to respect other people lives because it can cause serious problems in the family of the person or in his life. If the famous person doesn't mind in being filmed in his personal life there's no problem. But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity the media has to respect that. Everybody likes to be with your family without any reporter or photographer hanging around.###It's important to respect other people's lives because it can cause serious problems for the family of the person or in his life.

I was wondering if you would consider our suggestion about changing the programme. We agreed all that the programme on Monday March 13th is wonderful. However, we would like to change the plans on Tuesday and Wednesday in the morning. On Tuesday morning, we will visit the London Fashion and Leisure show instead of visiting the Science Museum and we will go there tomorrow morning. Visiting to the National Art Gallery should be cancelled because it has a similar idea comparing to the programme that we would like to go on Tuesday morning.###I was wondering if you would consider our suggestion about changing the programme.

There is evidence that these people's life should be advertised by the media. Obviously, they have a lot of fans and their fans would like to know what happened to them.

Sometimes, a lot of people don't know what to do and they should imitate.
However, there is other disadvantages that we should consider. Firstly, the famous people would like to do anything they want to without being concentrated by the media. I think it would is annoying if you did something and tomorrow your performance would be known by the public. Eventhough, the famous people can be the good example, they should be the bad habit for public. A lot of people try to be like people who they admire, For example, buying the clothes that famous people wear. The reason that they know what kind of clothes that famous people wear is these people have a public life. To Prevent many people from copying too much we shouldn't inform them of all aspects of the life of famous people.###However, there are some disadvantages that we should consider.

We can watch this problem from two different points of view. From one side, this people chose to become public people. If we don't want to be in the newspapers, we don't do politics or the movies! But, from the other, everybody has the right to have a secret garden, the right to be with his/her family without be disturbed by journalists and photographers. The case of the Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities.###We can consider this problem from two different points of view.

On your program of Tuesday is very interesting. Fortunately, there is the London fashion and leisure show, which is held once a year.

But we would like to suggest you something: There is a trendy event about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear; make up and hairstyles, on the 14th of March. It is called ,,The London Fashion and Leisure Show." This would be a great opportunity for us because we are all intrested in clothes, sports and fashion. I have almost forgotten to mention that it is free for students! Unfortunately we realised that on the 14th we will already visit the Science Museum. The show lasts nine hours, from 10.00-19.00, the whole day! Our question now is: Could we go to this show? We could maybe change Tuesday's programme to Wednesday. We all prefer to go to the show, free time is not so important for us.###But we would like to suggest something to you: there is a trendy event about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles, on the 14th of March.

The thing is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It will be held in the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday, 14th of March, from 10.00 to 19.00. Naturally, all the students are interested in it because the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles will be shown there. Furthermore, students can enter free!
We are concerned that this is a great and the only opportunity for us to see this show, as it takes place only once a year and only in London. Certainly, we do not refuse to take part in other activities in London. Probably, you will agree just to put the London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of the Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday.###We are concerned that this is a great and the unique opportunity for us to see this show, as it takes place only once a year and only in London.

Well, I suppose that almost everything in our future house will be automatic and will obey to what people say. Perhaps, there will be personal computers, which will control every thing, every item of furiture, light, temperature. Moreover, they will be able to create a special climate for each room. But, on the other hand, people will still have to programm them, as they have to do nowadays. Maybe children will not have to go to school, they just will stay in their rooms and study from a computer, gaining some kind of on-line education. All the rubbish, dust, dirty dishes, plates, caps will be washed and cleaned automaticly. It is possible that only one computer will do this all and it will have its own personality, voice, eyesight..###Well, I suppose that almost everything in our future house will be automatic and will respond to what people say.

This is such a fasinating story or it's the way Agatha Christie tells it. The mistery is kept until the last page of the book. I read it and I have really enjoyed it.

About the programme, we suggest to see the show on the Tuesday morning and after to do shopping. As far as we are concerned, we prefer seeing the Science Museum rather than the National Art Gallery. We also suggest to visit the Science Museum or Wednesday morning and in the afternoon, if some one of us is intersted, we could see the National Art Gallery.###About the programme, we suggest seeing the show on the Tuesday morning and afterwards go shopping.

General speaking, homes will change considerably. They will become less dark and more confortable than today.

We also will see very high buildings which contains a lot of narrow flats.###About the size of house, I think that in cities houses will be more and more small because of the overpopulation.

Thank you for organising the programme about the trip to London.

However, I am writing to suggest a special activity while we are in London.###Thank you for organising the programme for the trip to London.

Another reason that I agree that famous people deserve to have a private life is that if journalists followed them all the time, it would result in their death. For example, if Diana, who was the ex-wife of Prince Charles, hadn't been followed by paparachi when she was dating with a guy, there wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death.###Another reason that I agree that famous people deserve to have a private life is that if journalists followed them all the time, it would result in their death.

To sum up, nobody wants to be revealed their private life on public. Therefore, even famous people need their own life apart from the media.###To sum up, nobody wants their private life to be revealed in public. Therefore, even famous people need their own life apart from the media.
However, could we make a suggestion?

How wonderful it could be to see the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear in this city, so famous for it! Besides, as there are more girls than boys in the class, they would certainly enjoy attending on live make-up and hairstyles. Lastly, it is free for students, which is fantastic!###However, could we make a suggestion?

On the other hand, for other famous people, being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame. In my opinion, it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they have to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photograph. They cannot go to public places, unless they make-up themselves and they are ready to sign autographs. They would really like a normal life, either because it is their temper, a regarding to their children. Nevertheless, they are never let alone, which is a shame. We have to respect them as human beings, what we often forget they are. ###On the other hand, for other famous people, being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame.

It is very thoughtful of you that you are taking all of us to London. This is a great oppotunity for me to explore and experience London myself, especially, The London fashion and leisure shows.

It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I closed my eyes, tooke a deep breath and jumed out of the tower. There were hundrend of Thai students were waiting for doing this test. I was very afraid of the hieght and was very nervous. I was given the lists for doing the activities while I was going to the adventurous school schems at the solder camps in the north of Thailand. There were many tasks that I had to complete; for instance, clime up to the mountain, learn how to used some kind of guns, and how to survive when I got lost in the forest. The last task I had to do was jume out of the hight tower. The assistants were the real solders and they were very kind and helpful, eventhough, they looked very strick and unkind. It was the hardest time for me to do thing like this because I lived in the city most of my life and I had never known about how to survive in the forest and how difficult solders. I eventaully managed to complete all the tasks that I had given and I was very proud of this.###It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.

A couple of days ago, my classmates made the suggestion, that they would also like to see the London Fashion And Leisure Show in London, at the Central Exhibition Hall, which was advertised in a school magazine, and there is free entry for students. The show includes the latest fashion wear, sports wear for spare time, make up and hairstyles. At the same time it would be a great opportunity for most of us because we are going to study "Art and Design" next year.###A couple of days ago, my classmates made the suggestion, that they would also like to see the London Fashion And Leisure Show in London, at the Central Exhibition Hall, which was advertised in a school magazine, and there is free entry for students.

Well, first of all, I think it's quite difficult to be a musician, film star or a politician without being followed by journalists all the time. In my opinion, most of these people are aware of the consequences of fame, like not to have a "private life" anymore. As soon as they are famous, they are surrounded by their fans and reporters in every place. I can imagine, how annoying it can be sometimes. Just think that you'd like to go shopping, clubbing or to a restaurant with friends. There's really no way to be together just only with your friends or relatives without being disturbed by these paparazzis.###Well, first of all, I think it's quite difficult to be a musician, film star or a politician without being followed by journalists all the time.

On the one hand I can understand how important it is for the journalists to take pictures for the newspaper or magazines they work for.

But on the other hand I have to mention that they are going too far sometimes to take a picture. For example, Lady Diana. Do you think she would have been still alive if she and her boyfriend hadn't been followed by these nosy paparazzis?

However, the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London and where the latest fashions will be shown. There we will have the chance to be maked up or to try new hairstyles, too. And it has free-entrance for the students. We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place while our visit to London, on the 14th of March. We think that, if you don't have any problem, we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we can go to the London Fashion and Leisure show.###However, the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London and where the latest fashions will be shown.

From any point of view, the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today. I think that it will has a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that, for example, we can turn on the lights of the bedroom just by pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa.###my, the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today.

Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like an UFO, in my opinion the changes won't be very important, they will probably consist on making the houseworks easier. The cleanest example is to compare a house from the beginings of the 20th century with our house. Both are very similar but now we have new technologies. In balance then, I think that the houses that we can see on films won't really exist.###Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like a UFO, in my opinion the changes won't be very great, they will probably consist of making the housework easier.

I do not know if it is possible to make any change in this plan but we saw an ad in "Time Out" magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see. The show's date is very convinient - March 14 -, and it is on in the Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there.###I do not know if it is possible to make any changes to this plan but we saw an ad in "Time Out" magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see.

As you know, we all come from different countries and we are keen on learning some other things about English culture besides the language itself. Joining this fashion and leisure show, we will get the chance to see a lot of enjoyable and different things, such as new hair styles and make up ways, or what is the fashion in London recently.###As you know, we all come from different countries and we are keen on to learn some other things about English culture besides the language itself.

Briefly, we would be happy if we could see this show instead of the Science Museum. We can find another chance to go to the Science Museum in any other day, but this show is just for this Tuesday. Also, it's free for students. I hope, it wouldn't cause a trouble to change the programme. I look forward to hearing from you soon.###Briefly, we would be happy if we could see this show instead of the Science Museum.

Thinking about famous people, we generally tend to ignore this need. I believe this feeling sources from a strange though; when somebody gets famous, whatever the job is they do, we think we have some kind of right over them. Consequently we demand to know every single detail about them and their lives. Press takes this demand as an order, and "but the public wants to know" becomes a nightmare for famous people.###Thinking about famous people, we generally tend to ignore this need.

In fact, what is a need for ordinary people is a more important need for famous people. Because they have to spend too much time in front of other people, they are even more sensitive about their privacy. I am quiet sure, that even the ones, who have chosen their occupies just to be famous, don't like to be pictured when they believe they are alone. The situation much be much worse for the ones who have become famous without desiring this.###In fact, what is a need for ordinary people is a more important need for famous people.

Obviously, there is no point in saying "famous people have a right to their own live."

We have been very excited about this and coincidentely we have found another option to add in our programme, certainly if your agree with it. We have thought that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main transformation in nowdays in England about fashions, Leisure, sports and style of life.###We have been very excited about this and coincidentally we have found another option to add to our programme, certainly if you agree with it.

However, it is your decision in changing a little bit our programme, we would suggest just on Tuesday afternoon no doing shop, and everything else could stay the same. We are really satisfied in the sightseeing by bus, and in go to the National Gallery, but the whole class would like to go to The London Fashion Show and it will be free.###However, it is your decision in to change our programme a little bit.

Unfortunately, I've got a brother who likes to live in a dangerous and poor way and I don't know how, but he could persuade me to go with him to get some drugs, in my 25th birthday.

I had tried to think in stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scared me and he forced me to buy cocain using my cheques. I didn't want to, because I've never approve of his deal with the drug, but I couldn't do it different.###I had tried to think about stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scare me and he forced me to buy cocaine using my cheques.

According to me, you can't deserve to have a private life when you're famous because when you to start you career you know that the medias will be hunting you everywhere and the more famous you get the worst it is going to be because that is the life style people wants to know everything about, for instance, about their favourite actor or about their president.. they saw them many time on T.V. or in the Cinema, So people wonder about them.

The fashion show starts at 10:00 am and ends at 19:00 p.m. and will be realized on 14 March, so we can change the shopping with this event, that is realized in the afternoon, and put the shopping at night.

In my view Prince Charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media. When he goes skiing in Switzerland he always stops for a while to talk with the journalists and to give the photographers the chance to take pictures. After this break he continues to ski without be annoyed for the rest of the holiday.###In my view Prince Charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media.

it is not important whether they are working for media foundation or not, they just try to find the best pose.

On the other hand, famous people have a point, if they do not allow the paparazzis to take their pictures. Because, althoug they are famous they have also their private life. Unless they do not want to share it, it must be acceptable for us. I think the best example would be Lady Diana. It was said that while they were trying escape from the paparazzis they had that accidentthey had that accident while they were trying to escape from the paparazzi, which caused of their lives.

It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I climed up the tree. My friend was looking at me from below. I went on climbing until I saw my friend's model aeroplane. If I hadn't borrowed it from him, I wouldn't have been here. No, it wasn't the time to regret it, just get it and it would be all over. I stressed my arm, the branch I was standing on broke and I fell down on my leg. It was very hurt, my friend rushed to me, than ran back to my house and called Mom. I can't remember anything else until I woke up at a hospital, lying on a bed with my leg in plaster. The nurse sitting beside me said to me, 'Your mother would like to have a word with you,' then she went out. Mom came in, looking very angry, I prayed for a short conversation.###It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I climbed up the tree. My friend was looking at me from below.

First of all, I would like to say thank to you for this good programme, especially for the decision of going to visit in London. All of us is appreciated that we could have this opportunity. Because most students have never been to London before, also we could visit some famous places which we wanted to go to.###First of all, I would like to say thank to you for this good programme, especially for the decision of going to visit in London.

However, we would be grateful if you would arrange a time to visit the show additionally. This show takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00. In this show, not only can we see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles, but we also can enter for free. Moreover some students think that they would like to do fashion studies in future. If you would accept and wouldn't mind this idea, we would like to visit it instead of shopping in the afternoon on Tuesday.###However, we would be grateful if you would arrange a time to visit the show as well.

Few years ago, we had a terrible news of the death of Lady Diana. She was always been aftering by the media. She had no private life even though she wanted to be alone. Finally, after chasing for a long time, she was dead because of a car accident. It must be a good example of a media disaster. I understand she had a good reason to be chased by it. However, she definetely deserve to have a private life as one of citizen. Human right must be existed for all people.###A few years ago, we had the terrible news of the death of Lady Diana.

On the other hand, there are a few famous people who desire to be watched by the media. If the media stopped focusing on the people, they would think as if they are put in a bin like rubbish. Moreover, many people love to watch a gossip programme on TV or  in a magazine. It is one  of fun in our life.###On the other hand, there are a few famous people who desire to be watched by the media.

We hope changing the excursion program a little will not cause any problems. Our suggestion is to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday. Because the fashion show lasts a whole day long. We are ready to give up our shopping and Free time. The show starts on 14th March at 10.00 and ends at 19.00 the same day.

Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even or just a little privacy.

I had always wanted to be a theatre actress. I was saving my pocket money to go to the theatre  age of 15. During the this years I had met with Zuhal Olcoy. I had seen her every morning while I was going to school. Despite of the fact that going to school by bus was easier than riding by bycyle, I had prefered to going to school by bycyle to going by bus. In that way I had been able to see her every morning. The more seeing her I could, the more ambitious I became. At last I met wit her. She had invited me to her play to the theatre. When I went to her play to see, I  realy would love to be a actress. She was the only person who encourage me to be a actress.###I had always wanted to be a theatre actress. I saved my pocket money to go to the theatre  age of 15.

On my point of view the media's treatment of famous people is very bad. The media's are looking forward to create great expectations about famous people. They are not trying to give information, they are only looking to get money, and to entertain the public.###In my view the media's treatment of famous people is very bad.

It is certain that these people have fame, fortune and success, and that many of them are rich, very rich. They usually appear on TV, and go to shows, and sports competitions...

I have a few suggestion on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in . We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon. We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping. We can, however, go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show.###I have a few suggestions on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .

I see a very different home for us in the future. Most things will be computerised. We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys. We an on and off lights with touch pads and remote controllers. We might even be able to open the door without getting out from the living room. Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door.###I see a very different home for us in the future. Most things will be computerised.

Although all that may change our houses may be still the same. The rooms and size should remain as it was and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style.

In the future, every child might have a laptop. And instead of going to school, why not let school come to you? We will be learning at home using computers and disc. Never have to leave the house or wake up so early. Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using. We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot, a machine, or something other with the same purpose.###In the future, every child might have a laptop.

However, journalists should not only think about commercial value, but morality and priciples are also being concerned.

Although we can not deny it is our nature - we are curious, we can improve our sence of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them. Actually, I am happy to hear that journalists have learned their lesson from the death of Princess Diana and try to let her children and the Royal family have more privacy. Lets all leave them more freedom to enjoy their private lives.###Although we cannot deny it is our nature - we are curious - we can improve our sense of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them.

We hope to hearing from you soon.###We've noticed that the exhibition will be on Tuesday, the 14th of March. Could we change our programme?

You know I love reading books, it's my passion. I've read all the books of the English author Ernest Hemingway. They are great I tell you! But I think your cousin is too young for it. Why? Because he especially concentrates on the history, social life and politic situation in the time the story is played. That might be quiet complicated to understand, especially for young people. For me, his books are great. But anyway, do you know the book with the title 'The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie'? It's written by Agatha Christie. She's an American and her books concentrate on crime and detective stories. Her books aren't difficult to understand. She especially write books for young people. And I think this book is a very good one for your cousin. You wrote that your cousin is quite intered in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? I think this is the best choice for him!###You know I love reading books, it's my passion. I've read all the books of the English author Ernest Hemingway. They are great I tell you!

May I suggest an alternative plan? We could go to the science museum on wednesday morning and to the National Art Gallery too. We only need wake up earlier and take part of the lunchtime to do both the same morning, but that would leave us go to the show on tuesday, because we can use the wednesday's free time to do our shopping. I hope that my idea sweet you and you'll agree.###May I suggest an alternative plan? We could go to the science museum on Wednesday morning and to the National Art Gallery too.

I understood that you're looking for your cousin's birthday present, and you'd like give to him a book, which, I think, it's a good idea. The last book I read was Wuthering Heights by Emilie Brontë. It's a fantastique book, which I recommend to everybody keen on lovestories. It's a perfect combinaison between passion and life difficulties. I recone that it's quite not an easy reading, but as you described your cousin, I think she really will enjoy it, she's such good in litteracy, that it won't be a problem for her. I really think you should choose this one for her, it does go with her personnality. It'll be a good point for her general culture, Wuthering Heights it's a classic, which everybody knows about it, even if they didn't have read it, they, at liest, know the story.###I understand that you're looking for a birthday present for your cousin, and you'd like to give to her a book, which, I think, is a good idea.

I've heard that the Leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles are really wonderful. It is also free for students. We all know that you organised everything. However, we can change the programme. Here are some suggestions that I would like to let you know. We have some free timer on Wednesday the 15th of March in the afternoon so we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday. We can also do our shopping quickly after sightseeing of London.###I would like to give you some details about the show that I saw in an advertisement yesterday.

That time, I couldn't imagine how my life would change. After I had had my breakfast I put my clothes on. I didn't want anybody to recognise me. Despite feeling really bad I left home. I got into my car and started it. When I arrived at the bank I got out of the car and went into the bank. I told everybody to lie down. They did it. I asked the cashier to give me all the money. Before I took the money one of the cashier had pressed a button to call a police. I quickly left the bank.###At that time, I couldn't imagine how my life would change.

However, it didn't take long that they caught me soon. The policeman arrested me and I stayed in a prison for 15 years. The worst thing was my friend died after 10 days I was arrested.###However, it didn't take long for them to catch me soon. The policeman arrested me and I was in a prison for 15 years.

Unfortunately, our programm is fixed but I think we could change the part of the programme. For example, "shopping on 14, March' can be changed to 15, March instead of "Free time". So we will be able to use the time at the afternoon on 14, March for visiting the show.###Unfortunately, our programme is fixed but I think we could change the part of the programme.

But on the other hand, ordinary people, including me, are keen on watching film stars or super models fashion. Moreover, people are interested in their life style. I think that is the reason why journalists are still chasing famous people after "Princess Diana's" accident.###But on the other hand, ordinary people, including me, are keen on watching film stars or super models fashion.

However, secondly, famous people are not "ailen" so that they might do something, for example, ashame things in a public space, or argument with a partner or family, even put on a swimming costume like us. So they can be just ordinaly people like us. We have to think about it this way.###However, secondly, famous people are not "alien" so that they might do something, for example, shameful things in a public space, or argue with a partner or family, even put on a swimming costume like us.

Overall, people should think about what it would be like if we were famous people... and then we can find the answer that all people, including famous people, need a private life and would like to behave in ordinaly life.###Overall, people should think about what it would be like if we were famous people... and then we can find the answer that all people, including famous people, need a private life and would like to have an ordinary life.

I would like to mention that on this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping, so I believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students! The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is suitable as well with our programme because until 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping.###I would like to mention that on this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping, so I believe it will be a good chance for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students!

Secondly, I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly about what does it include. The latest fashion will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear. Really interesting! Moreover all about the make up and the hairstyles. I think that it will be a great opportunity to all of us to be on this show while we are going to be in London. But, if there is a problem that the show is on Tuesday afternoon, the same hour with shopping, I suggest having the shopping on Wednesday afternoon that we will not have anything to do!###Secondly, I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly about what does it includes.

Some people think that to be a famous person is a very excuiting thing, that all the time this makes you feel completely and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well.###Some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing, that all the time this makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well.
I believe, that if somebody wants the fame and the glory he must be tottally sure about the results. For example, the politicians the have choosed their careers, they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important thing is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have a bad reputation, and they will be not considered trustworthy.###I believe, that if somebody wants the fame and the glory he must be totally clear about the results.

succesfull. If somebody is a film star this mean that he has got a different kind of life, a more comfortable, more interesting life but it doesn't mean that he or she can't be like normal people even if he or she is a star.###successful.

If somebody wants to be famous of cource they must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her. But I think that the are limits. Everybody deserve to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer. It doesn't matter what kind of carreer or job you are follow. You must control your behaviour and try not implove so much yourself. And finally the journalists the should know how to respect the private life of everyone and not trying to make money for a living by using the reputation of the famous people.###If somebody wants to be famous of course they must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her.

Secondly, I wonder if you know it will have "London fashion and Leisure Show" be showed on Tuesday in the Central Exhibition Hall. In other words, what they will introduce, is most interested in us, I mean it's conflict with your plan, what a pity!###Secondly, I wonder if you know that the "London fashion and Leisure Show" will be held on Tuesday at the Central Exhibition Hall.

One day, I passed by a river in accident, I saw there were a lot of people playing in the river. Suddenly, I heard a cry of "help, help" in my distance. In a while, lots of passed-by crowed to the river-side. To my surprise, nobody want in to save that boy who was shouting, but just stood there, like lots of "champ". I started think about it, after all, neve. I was just 15 years old. Finally, I jumped into the river, I really knew that was dangerous, but I haven't think about anything except "justify" this word. I also extremely hated those people who stood there all the time.###One day, I passed by a river in accident. I saw there were a lot of people playing in the river.

Front my point of view, we are very interested in the latest fashions like the leisure wear, sports wear, make up, hairstyles, you know ...

Well, you can look at your house ... Nowadays, we have all kind of instruments to washing up the dishes, for to cook to be more comfortable, for example, the TV, the video recorder, etc.###Well, you can look at your house ...

Maybe, in a few years later we'll have a bigger TV, a more suitable radio but, from my point of view, I think these facts will not change the way of our lifes. We will be able to accelerate the process of the computer's games, for example... But not in the strange way you can imagine...I mean I don't think we'll change cars by aereoplanes...###Maybe, in a few years' time we'll have a bigger TV, a more suitable radio but, in my opinion, I think these facts will not change our way of our lives.

In this way, you have to be calm because, as you know, the things are developing and in the same way you'r changing, too. In conclusion, I strongly believe that the the house of the future will be the house of a new mindness it will be a very positiu point for opening up our lifes. So, we have the future in our hands!

Dear Principal, First of all, we would like to thank you for the good programme which provides us with 3 days stay in London.  It contains a wide range of activities, for example, sightseeing, a river trip, visiting the science museum and gallery, shopping.  It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment. However, we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show, which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March.  The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes, such as the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles etc.  Moreover, students are allowed to admit for free.###Dear Principal, First of all, we would like to thank you for the good programme which provides us with 3 days' stay in London.

All of us would like to attend the show because young people, particularly girls, are interested in fashion and make up, so we are expecting the show will be the great opportunity to see what the new trend in fashion will be like. It would be grateful if you give a little change in the programme so that we are able to attend the show.  It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th into the London Fashion and Leisure show, instead of the science museum and shopping.  I am looking forward to hearing from you.###All of us would like to attend the show because young people, particularly girls, are interested in fashion and make-up, so we are expecting the show to be a great opportunity to see what the new trends in fashion will be like.

Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has considerably been changed by rapdily developing mordern technology.  To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning woods to warm a room up and make food.  Since the eletric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their life have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend many times on making food, washing up, or even on turning on an off the light.  Machines, such as a dish washer, laundry machine and remote controller help us jut to relax or do a little work necessary. From my point of view, people's home in the future will be controlled by a computer which is devised in every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connecting to the owner.  He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a "family".  In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves. Computer might know better than a human, but there are many things which it can not replace in our life.###Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has been changed considerably by rapidly developing modern technology.

It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I was having a holidays with my parents and some friends in India and we were enjoying talking to people and eating the local food. One day we were invited from some locals to visit a little town five hours away from New Dehli. Although my parents were very happy of having such an especial opportunity of visiting a place with no tourists, I was a little bit scared.###It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.

Being famous and risk is something all of us have dreamt of sometimes. But not always famous people are happy of their condition. Usually if you ask them what they would desire most, the answer is: "I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do."###Being rich is something all of us have dreamt of at some time. But famous people aren't always happy with their situation. Usually if you ask them what they would desire most, the answer is: "I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do."
There is no surprise to this answer: famous people can not have their own private life. Whenever they go out they are suddenly "hounded" by groups of journalists and photographers who want an interview or a photo. They can not even have a pizza with friend who stops them and asks them for an autograph. But the worst thing of all is that they are often the victim of malicious gossips, which most of the times are not even true.###This answer is no surprise: famous people cannot have their own private life.

In conclusion, I believe that it is certainly tight that famous people accept their condition, with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings, on the other hand, however, I think that they deserve to have a private life as all other people have. Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depresed: not always, in fact, money and celebrity being happiness.###In conclusion, I believe that it is certainly right that famous people accept their situation, with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings.

Taking the programme and the show into consideration, we suggest that we can have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday. We suppose that in our free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping. We hope that you consider our suggestion.###Taking the programme and the show into consideration, we suggest that we would have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday.

However, I have a great proposition for you. Students in my class have recently seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. I thing it is a great opportunity for us, as it is at the time of our being in London and is free of charge for students. Girls should like to see the latest fashion, new make-up and interesting hairstyles. Boys are interested in seeing leisure and sportswear.###However, I have a great proposition for you.

Many people think that we will resign from a kitchen, which is a useless place, as we will spend most of the time at work and will eat outside. I do not think so. Because of computers, we will have the possibility of working at home, therefore, home will be a very important place worth paying attention to.###Many people think that we will resign from a kitchen, which is a useless place, as we will spend most of the time at work and will eat outside.

As you can see this is the best time to go there. We have some suggestions about how to change the programme. Instead of visiting the Science Museum on Tuesday we could go there on Wednesday afternoon and instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon we could maybe stop at some places during the sightseeing tour and buy there something.###As you can see this is the best time to go there.

In our society some people are treated like animals in the zoo by the press. Just because they are famous and well known to a high number of other people. The newspapers print everything about them. The yellow press is searching for every little bit of information they can get. The photographers are chasing these people, just to take a picture of them on how they eat or with who the meat. The photos will be on tomorrow's press and so rumours are born.###In our society some people are treated like animals in the zoo by the press, just because they are famous and well known to a high number of other people.

All of us want to go to this trip, but some of my classmates saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and we all would like to go there. It is from 10 am to 7 p.m., it is about the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles, all of us are really interesting, and it is free for student to get in as well. It is a really good opportunity to go because most of us are studying fashion design, and we can learn loads of things in there. So may you please change the visit of the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon, and we can cancel our shopping and free time, so we can go to the fashion show on Tuesday.###All of us want to go on this trip, but some of my classmates saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and we would all like to go there.

In the second day, we had to climb up a twenty metres hill with our hands. It was so difficult for me because I was really scared to stand in a high place since I was young. I did not want to climb up but I did not have any choice. So I started to climb really slow and careful, and I climbed about 15 metres quite success, so I tried to climb quicker because the destination was not far away. But after I climbed two steps more, my right feet slipped over, I was nearly fell down, but luckly my hand caught a rock, it was dangerous, but I didn't had any choice, finally I did it.###On the second day, we had to climb up a twenty-metre hill with our hands.

In my opinion I think that if famous people is always followed by journalists it is not the responsability of the media but of the huge quantity of people who are interested in famous people life. Firstly, because it is a lot of "scandale magazine readers". Secondly, it is because they have a lot of admiration for them and lastly because they want dreams and see what a "star life" look like.###I think that if famous people are always followed by journalists it is not the responsibility of the media but of the huge number of people who are interested in famous people's lives.

I would like to suggest an idea and change the sightseeing by bus on Monday, because the English weather is so changeable. If it rains, we will not be pleasant.

On the other hand, our class has recently read an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which takes place during our visit to London, on Tuesday 14th. This show is a good opportunity to know the latest fashions in several topics, like make up, Hairstyles and leisure and sports wear. We think that it could be a great chance in order to know British fashion and probably it would give us good information for improving our studies.###On the other hand, our class has recently seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which takes place during our visit to London, on Tuesday 14th.

I know that it is a change. But I have thought about it. On Monday we could first go to the Sience Museum and in the afternoon to Greenwich. Then we could go sightseeing by bus on Wednesday after lunchtime. I think there is no need to go shopping because we can do our shopping in Cambridge, as well.###I know that it involves a change but I have thought about it.

Dear Mr. Robertson Thank you for your good programme for the English class, especially since it is well-organised and has many different places we can go and we can see. All of us in the English class look forward to visiting these places. However, we'd like to ask about London Fashion and Leisure Show that we've seen an advertisement for on this week college newspaper. We would appreciate it if you could give us a chance to go there while we are visiting in London. It should be a great opportunity for us because we can see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and Hairstyles, As you know, this year is our final year and most of us would like to get a job straight away after this course. We've been worried about our future career and we believe that we need some preparation for it such as advice about dress and hairstyle for an interview. And mostly, it should be a great opportunity for the Art students who are attending English class. Most of students in our class are studying Fashion as full-time. Especially, it does not cost anything at all for students. But the only problem for the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00. As we're considering your programme we're supposed to go to the Science Museum and shopping. We're thinking that we can go to these place the next following day. But Mr. Robertson, these our suggestions are depended on your programme, we're just suggesting. Again we're so sorry that we give you an inconvience for your plan and thank you for considering us. We are look forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely,###Dear Mr. Robertson Thank you for your good programme for the English class, especially since it is well-organised and has many different places we can go and we can see. All of us in the English class look forward to visiting these places. However, we'd like to ask about London Fashion and Leisure Show that we've seen an advertisement for in this week's college newspaper. We would appreciate it if you could give us a chance to go there while we are visiting in London. It should be a great opportunity for us because we can see the latest fashions, leisure and sportswear, make-up and hairstyles. As you know, this year is our final year and most of us would like to get a job straight away after this course. We've been worried about our future career and we believe that we need some preparation for it such as advice about dress and hairstyle for an interview. And mostly, it should be a great opportunity for the Art students who are attending English class. Most of students in our class are studying Fashion as full-time. Especially, it does not cost anything at all for students. But the only problem with the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00. As we're considering your programme we're supposed to go to the Science Museum and shopping. We're thinking that we can go to these places the next following day. But Mr. Robertson, these our suggestions depend on your programme, we're just suggesting. Again we're so sorry that we are giving you an inconvenience regarding your plan and thank you for considering us. We are looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely,
Living in a high building! But we could have everying we want to. Home might be a mixture with moden styles and a natural view as well.###Living in a high building! But we could have everything we want to. Home might be a mixture with modern styles and a natural appearance as well.

So I think that the future home could be considered this points. I mean most of home are going to be in a building like a flat. Maybe it is right say that in a flat instead of a building. I believe there are a lot of high buildings now in Japan. Most of them are flats which have at lest 20 Floors. It means the Japanese are planning for the future home.###So I think that the future home could be considered this points. I mean most of homes are going to be in a building like a flat.

But what my imagination is that these flats'll have many functions such as offices, leisure centre, shopping centre even school.

By the way, our classmates have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and leisure show. It will show us the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear. In addition, make up and hairstyles shows will take place at the same time. We think it would be a wonderful chance to have a new experience. What is even better, is that all students can participate without paying. It takes place at Central Exhibition hall in London. And it starts from 10 to 19 on 14th of March. So we would like to suggest you to put this programme into the morning time on Tuesday instead of the Science Museum and put the science museum into free time on Wednesday.###By the way, our classmates have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and leisure show.

Our homes will be different in the way to protect our family from theives. For example, now we have a security safety like a bell or button. But in the future, we'll use our eyes or finger prints through the special space to enter inside. That is, our security system will be much stronger. On the other hand, what migh still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home, such as a beautiful garden, a small terrace. Because it is a instinct that people prefer comfortable place and want to take a rest in a peaceful place.###Our homes will be different in order to protect our family from theives.

First of all, you might not know what this show is about. In fact, it is a big exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. It would be interesting for us to see all that "live", rather than on TV. Furthermore, it is a great opportunity for us because the entry is free for students so it will not affect the budget. The show takes place on 14th March from 10 o'clock to 7 o'clock. We all think that it would be most enjoyable to go to the Science museum until about 11 o'clock and then move on to the show. It would be a good idea to leave at about 5 or 6 o'clock so that we can go shopping for a while.###First of all, you might not know what this show is about.

We had decided to climb that more than 3'700-metre-high mountain near Arolla in Switzerland two weeks beforehand. We had been preparing the trip for several days when we started to climb the mountain, on that 4th of September 1995. It all went as expected and we reached the summit in six hours. However, it started to go wrong after one hour of downhill walking. My friend fell down and badly hit his leg against a rock. We could immediatly see that it was broken. He couldn't move any more and my mobilephone was not able to find a proper network. We were trapped!###We had decided to climb that more than 3,700-metre-high mountain near Arolla in Switzerland two weeks beforehand.

I finally decided to carry him on my back on the way back to the rescue chalet. It was dangerous because of the steepness of the slope and we risked falling down all the time. However, we would have frozen to death if we had stood where we were. After ten more exhausting hours of walking we finally reached the chalet, from which we were able to call a helicopter.

This show consists of a big fair in the Central Exhibition Hall in which we will have the opportunity of seeing the latest releases on sports wear, make up, and hairstyles. I believe it could be an enriching experience for all of us. We would be having fun, meeting the locals and practising our English at the same time. Furthermore, we would be speaking English outside school.###This show consists of a big fair in the Central Exhibition Hall in which we will have the opportunity of seeing the latest releases in sportswear, make up, and hairstyles.

Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie###Best Detective Stories by Agatha Christie
You told me your cousin likes suspense books and stories, the ones in which you keep trying to figure it out who is the killer. Agatha Christie's stories just couldn't be more suitable for your cousin. Specially because there isn't just one story, but a whole lot of them. Personally speaking, I think they selected the best ones to be published.###You told me your cousin likes suspense books and stories, the ones in which you keep trying to figure it out who is the killer.

We would like to know if all of us can join in this event. We all agree that we are going to join the school trip to the Science Museum, which is the most interesting trip for us.

It was dangerous, but I know I had to do it. Even though all of my friends who were with me in that day all said, "Just let it go, it's just only a puppy. Why do you have to take a risk?"

If you imagine how dangerous you were while you had to stop your car and got off of the car on the highway where there were only car at least 120 km/hr running along your side. It was true that small dog were in danger, but your life was in that situation as well once you decide to do that brave thing. All my body was shaking, and I would almost have turned back to my car if I didn't here that small creature cry as if he wanted me to be his owner.###If you imagine how dangerous you were while you had to stop your car and got out of the car on the highway where there were only car at least 120 km/hr running along your side.

I believe all the people, famous or not, deserve to have a private life without journalists to following them all the time. They are humans like all of us, with their problems, their good and bad times, and of course they don't want to be publish them in front of millions of people because a journalist thought that this is right.

Our class really appreciate for preparing this programme, especially for Monday's atraction. We are extremaly interested in wisiting London. The idea of sightseeing by bus would be a great possibility for us to know better our wonderful capitol. Although we are excited about the scientic, I would like you to ask, if it would be possible to change our schedule a little bit. In the last edition of 'London's Guide' we saw an advert of 'The London Fasion and Leisure Show', which will be held on Tuesday and it lasted from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The offer mentiones the 'latest fasions', which we are incredible interested in. In addition it recommends also the 'Leisure and Sports Wear'. Thing which attract us the most are: 'Make up' and 'Hairstyles'. We strongly recommend it, because students' admission is free. I'm convinced that you agree with us and we take part in this show.###Our class really appreciate your preparing this programme, especially with regard to Monday's attraction.

To begin with, we enjoy reading gossips about famous stars and politicians, although they sometimes aren't truly. In addition we are fascinated in their marriage, children, holidays etc. What is more it was their own choice to become popular and well-known. By chosing this style of life they should realise, how their life would look like.###To begin with, we enjoy reading gossip about famous stars and politicians, although they sometimes aren't true.

There is only one thing that we'd like to change, if you wouldn't mind.

We suggest to visit the Science Museum on Monday after the sightseeing tour by bus. We think we'll find one free hour befor the River trip. It would be a good solution.

I think that it must be awful to know that you are observed by journalists or other people, your fans for example, all 24 hours in a day, and the all things you do in your life are published and the whole world knows who is your friend, where you go shopping, who you love in and who you sleep with. On my opinion this is the worst thing that can ever happen.###I think that it must be awful to know that you are observed by journalists or other people, your fans for example, all 24 hours in a day, and all the things you do in your life are published and the whole world knows who are, where you go shopping, who you love in and who you sleep with.

It was a fantastic sunny day of August and my friends and I took a day off from work. There were just four of us. We all decided to go to have a day by the seaside not far away from Portsmouth. When we got there we were wearing our costumes. We lied on the sand under the sun, we had funny beach volley matches, interesting chats, but after two hours there, my friends decided to go swimming. For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons before and my friends didn't know about that. I didn't want to tell them because I was sure they would have started laughing of me. So I took the decision to go and join them also if I knew that it would have been dangerous for my life. I walked very slowly through the water and I was very scared but I had to do it because if I didn't go my friends could understand that something was wrong with me. In the end fortunately everything went well as I didn't sink in the sea. After that day, I decided taking up swimming, so that I would have had no embarrass in the future trips to the seaside any more.###It was a fantastic sunny day in August and my friends and I took a day off from work.

The London Fashion And Leisure Show is taking place in the Central Exhibition Hall in London and happens on Tuesday March 14. From ten o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock in the afternoon. The reason that I suggest that we go is that it is a great opportunity because we can see the latest fashions, in leisure and sports wear as well as make up and different hairstyles. In addition to these we will not have to pay anything since it is free for students.###The London Fashion And Leisure Show is taking place in the Central Exhibition Hall in London and happens on Tuesday March 14, from ten o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock in the evening.

In answer to your questions: I would like to travel in July. I am a full-time student, my summer holidays begin at the end of June and I have planned to work on my grandfather's farm in August. So July is the only time I will be free. Secondly, I would prefer tents to log cabins. Camping is my enthusiasm and I sleep in tents every time I go camping. Therefore, I am afraid I can't get used to log cabins easily. Besides camping, I also like painting. My Dad is an amateur painter, and I have begun painting for 8 years. I'm good at portraits and landscapes. I would also like to play golf during my holiday, but I have never played it before, will I get any tuition?###In answer to your questions: I would like to travel in July.

Everyone likes sale, but those so-called sale items are not really of value. In the fashion industry, sale begins at the end of each season and just lasts a short time, because those owners want to make room for new stock. But you'll find your 'cool bargain' soon get out of date and you have to keep buying new ones. Also supermarket owners have put in a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit. Therefore, we become impulsive buyers easily under the influence of these tricks. The result, is we feel guilty after spending more than we've estimated, or even suffer from financial difficulty.###Everyone likes sales, but those so-called sale items are not really good value.

Shopping does not just effect us mentally, but also physically. It's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping. Think of the awful crowds, the busy car parks, polluted air in the city centres and mile-long queues in front of the cash desks. I don't think anyone would really like to face them. But once you get there, they're just inevitable, aren't they?###Shopping does not just affect us mentally, but also physically. It's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping.

First of all, shopping is tiring because of the people who are doing the same thing as you the same day! Especially If you go shopping on a Saturday, when people are week-end. Streets are crowded and you can't walk easily.

One could be when you go into a shop and you can find something that you like, and you decide to buy it, but when you see the price, you find out that it's too expencive, and you cannot afford to buy it.

Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended to, the people that work in the shop are doing other things, and cannot help you, so you have to look for the things you want to buy by your own. I think this is a common problem in shops, and that's why sometimes people leave the shop without buying anything, and I thing the solution would be to hire more workers.###Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended to.

Dear Kim: Hi! How are you? How has your family been? I hope you are doing fine, I am and so is my family and everything around here. You are not going to believe what happened last month!!! I helped Korn in a concert they had at the Auditorium. I met this guy in a party. His name is Jimme, he is a really nice guy. Maybe, you will meet him one day. So, it turned out that Jimme was organizing the concert and he asked me and three of my friends if we wanted to help at the concert.

My name is Alois Blau and I'm very happy that I've won this competition.

Places to video: We should try to video not only class rooms but also our playground, cafe, sport hall, art club & library. Most students spend a lot of their time in such places and they are a very important part of our school life.###Places to video: We should try to video not only classrooms but also our playground, cafe, sports hall, art club & library.

I friend of mine had been helping at a few concerts before, so that time the agency rang him and asked him if he could bring someone else, because they'd run out of stuff. He asked to me to go and when he told me the group was Radiohead I felt like the luckiest person in the world (you know I've always been an enthusiastic fan of them, so you can imagine how excited I was). I couldn't wait for it.###I friend of mine had been helping at a few concerts before, so that time the agency rang him and asked him if he could bring someone else, because they'd run out of staff.

Besides I would prefer staying in a tent. It provides me a feeling of adventure, which is very exciting. I'm also very glad to see such a variety of activities on offer at the camp. It's quite difficult to say wether I prefer painting or sailing. All in all I have never practised Golf nor surfing, so let's try it!###Besides I would prefer staying in a tent.

Eventually, I would like to know where the camp is located. Will I have the opportunity to visit San Franscico or Los Angles? I would love it!

It would be interesting to film a math lesson. As it is very boring, everybody would understand how difficult it is to get good marks at the final examination.###It would be interesting to film a math lesson.

I would like to travel only in July, because I have so many assignments to finish before the end of June. I do not think I have enough time to prepare somethings to travel before of July. In fact, I really do not mind to stay in log cabins, but I have never stayed in a tent before. I think its might be fun to try to stay in the tent this time. I would prefer to choose tennis and swimming. I used to be a tennis player when I was fifteen. I won first prize two years ago. The other activity is swimming. I started to learnt when I was five years old. I was a swimming teacher for a year in a sports club. Now I own a swimming school and have trained the staffs every week. I think both activities I have chosen are suitable for me and I am sure I can do well.###I would like to travel only in July, because I have so many assignments to finish before the end of June.

First of all, I had to been train by the concert's staff for a day. Before the concert started I had to help the staff prepared a stage, doing things like put the instruments where they should be on the stage,. And then, I had to help the singer to do some make up. I was very frightening I might put too much make up on their faces, but everything was allright. After that, I had to help them to prepare some lunch when the concert had started. I was running around to find something I could do, like serving some drinks for the staffs or the singers.###First of all, I had to be trained by the concert staff for a day.

But shopping is not always enjoyable. Especially if you are going with women or children to the shops. That is my worst nightmare. I never go shopping with women, and especially with my mother or my sisters. And that's because they spend hours trying on any kind of clothes, everything you can imagine, and at the end they are not buying anything. They also like going to loads of shops, in different parts of the city. At the end I feel very tired and angry, because I spent the whole morning doing nothing, except from looking at them trying on diferent clothes, and that's not enjoyable at all, in fact it's realy annoying.###But shopping is not always enjoyable.

Also, you have to be careful when you go for shopping with children.

I'm very keen on photography, especially while I'm staying in the Sates. I might have lots of chances to take photos of beautiful nature. So I'm longing to take part in that activity, photography. Actually I've been in an amature photographer's organization for 3 years. And I'd like to choose swimming as the other one. I learned swimming at my age of 8 for 5 years and I still love swimming.

We've been thinking about the plot, at first, and we decided it would be the best way, the flow of time. The lessons we have in the morning doesn't attract us very much, but this bit will show you the routine scenery of a lesson. Spoken English lessons which is in the afternoon are quite interesting. Every the students keep talking about he theme and give their opinions. So we're going to organize about 10 minutes' short debate just for this video, but we haven't decided when it will be and the subject.###We've been thinking about the plot, at first, and we decided it would be the best way, the flow of time.

About the activities listed on your letter, I choose basketball and singing. I have played basketball for six years, and I've been in competitions for five years. I have good singing skills too. I have sung in the church's choir for three years, and I have had singing classes at school since first grade. I have recorded a demo tape, which I can send to you if you will, in which I also play the guitar.###About the activities listed in your letter, I choose basketball and singing.

Problems start when we cannot find any space to park our car. When we finally do this, we cannot go confortable because of the crowd. Why its always the same! The answer is that we choose the same street (usually the most popular) and the same time as six hundrets other people. We become customers who want to do their shopping with pleasure. I think we can achieve pleasure at home with our new goods.###Problems start when we cannot find any space to park our car. When we finally do this, we cannot be comfortable because of the crowds.

Sincerely, I must admit, that I don't like shopping in supermarkets and big stores. There are always too many people there. As I'm not keen of being a part of the crowd, I prefer a calm atmosphere in more isolated small shops. Furthermore, it takes too long to find something you need in unfamiliar stores.###Sincerely, I must admit, that I don't like shopping in supermarkets and big stores.

Another thing I dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assisstants which try to sale any products to the "victim" entring the door.

I would like to join the camp in July because I could get a holiday from my company from 1th July to 28th July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay in tents. In my experience, I've never tried to stay in tents during the holiday. That's why I'd like to feel adventurally. It could be a good, memorable thing for me. And I am interested in swimming and singing. When I was 17 years old, I could be able to won a swimming competition which is held in a local stadium. I had won second prize. And also, I have been joining a music bend in my school. I'm responsible for lead vocal. Every Monday we're having a practice time.###I would like to join the camp in July because I can get a holiday from my company from 1th July to 28th July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay in tents.

As I'm an artist student in a particular College, I only can go to your Camp California in July, because in this month I got no any class, and I'm free to do whatever I want to. I'd like a log cabins as my accomodation, because it's safer and cleaner than a tents and I wouldn't share it to anyone.###As I'm an art student at a particular College, I can only go to your Camp California in July, because in that month I haven't got any classes, and I'm free to do whatever I want to.

Painting and Photography are the activities good for me. They fit to myself because my art work develops itself in these areas. In Painting I talk about human beings in this world, in big canvases; and in Photography, with Collages, I talk about anger and guilty in the families' lines. So in Camp California I would like to keep me on touching to these areas.###Painting and Photography are the good activities for me. They suit me because my art work develops itself in these areas.

I'd like to ask you to send me $1000 for my art knowledge. With this amount I could buy a lot of art books, and records.

There is joy in shopping when it is made by ourselves to ourselves. It means buying whatever we like, just like clothes, records, rings, and books.

On the other hand, sickness in ourselves or our relatives made us unhappy to buy. It is an obligation shopping for medicines, clothes to winter, doctor visites, and so forth.

Then the activities that I would like to do are Singing and Swimming.

But not everything about shopping is enjoyable. For example, I hate it when I get into a shopping centre and it is crowded. I don't like it when I have to try on differents sizes because the small size doesn't fit on my body because I have got weight.

For me went to shop it's not the best thing I can do. Well I think the opposite like a year before but recently I think this because I see all the people to go shopping and they don't realised that they are outside in the real world there are poor people who need that money and they are only spent on material things, you would put you money in the bank because you don't need it now, but tomorrow you don't know. I like to shop sometimes but not always and not spending a lot of money on things that I don't really need. At the rest of you who don't understand this, it's on your memories to keep shopping and spending all your money on things that you don't really need.###For me going shopping is not the best thing I can do.

Most people believe that shopping is the most entertaining way. Some people when they are in a sadness, they will go shopping to forget every thing and the fact is that every body knows how to shopping. If you have chilldren, you will know it very well that when you are busy doing something and the chilldren see something they want to have, they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them, sometime they even cry or shout to you and it is really anoy you. However, they are happy after they have it. Anyway, even in families they usauly have this problem that when they bought a new one, suddenly they have a problem that where the old one is going to be and that is the begining of an argument between mother and farther or parents and chilldren. Eventually I like shopping to and I beleive every body like shopping, but before you buy something think before and you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough meney for survive.###Most people believe that shopping is the most entertaining way.

Most of the students agree in saying that there are two are the main features of our daily life at school which should be filmed: it would be very funny to dwell on us working and speaking together, without the help of the teacher, to show our efforts and sometimes successful and sometimes ridiculous and also to film some amusing moments we spent waiting for the teacher.###Most of the students agree in saying that there are two are the main features in our daily life at school which should be filmed: it would be very funny to concentrate on us working and speaking together, without the help of the teacher, to show our efforts and sometimes successful and sometimes ridiculous and also to film some amusing moments we spend waiting for the teacher.

Firstly, I arrived five hours before the begining of the concert in order to help the musicians to move the material from the van to the scene. As soon as all the conections was made, we tested the nivel of the sound: I found it too loud, so I advised them to regular it, and they listed to me!

Thus, it was a fantastic afternoon because I like very much music, even if I don't play any music instrument. Moreover, I learnt a lot about music, especially concerning the way of using an instrument. Consequently, I hope I will play an instrument in the future, especially because the group promises me to help me to learn any instrument.###So, it was a fantastic afternoon because I like music very much, even if I don't play any musical instrument.

About the two activities I need to select, I think the best one are swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I really love doing it, I used to swim every day in the sea a few years ago, I felt really healthy.

A thing I would like ask is if I need special clothes, I don't know what kind of camp I am going to.

Sometimes going shopping can be stressful. Can you imagen be in Japan or China and have to go to the shops?

In my opinion shopping is not the thing that I would like to do in my free time.

I was starting to sell the tickets when a person who organised told me to go into the lodge. They needed one person for putting the clothes into a wardrobe. It was the lodge of Mylene Farmer. Are you thinking? I was so exciting! Unfortunately, I didn't see her but it allowed me to talk with her manager, John, and her musicians. They All were very kindly and pleasant. It was a big moment for me. Finally these people are like us, they have just a special job with special times. The next year, if it will be possible, I would like go back with you.

The other day, I worked at a pop concert to help. It was really more interesting than I expected. My job at behind the stage was helping with make-up, hare and clothes staylist. It was very hard. The singers often changed them clothes and them make-up was easy to be off because of the sweat. It was different from when I did it at college. There was no time to rest. But I met a lot of famous singer and spoke to them. In front of the stage was so many people and they couldn't see them very well, but I was at very near from the stage and I could see them just there.###The other day, I worked at a pop concert to help.

A survey has been done, and the issue is, wich subjects (lessons) and activities the students thinks are the most enjoyables. Someone says it is maths, pratical, usefull  -  but the majority says it is boring, unless you're chose a job which charges all your math's knowledge such as accounting, otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer. The majorite has chosen History, which means a big journey around the world, midle. People must get some rest often, and as a result they look forward to some happiness at the free time such as, party, games, and every one loves party , it should have been filmed.###A survey has been done, and the issue is, which subjects (lessons) and activities the students think are the most enjoyable.

I think, I could have an holiday just in July because I will have been working in my previous company for one year by the end of the June and I will have a one month holiday period from my company.

As you know, I'd never been to any activities like to be a valunteer before. The concert tickets were very expensive and I'd seen an adversitement on the tv.

You should have seen it, there was a really terrible rush before the concert and everybody was runing around to do something. I helped to carry huge speakers to the concert venue. Than I was told to stay in front of the entrance door and check the tickets. Some people tried to enter without any ticket but they weren't allowed  by the police.###You should have seen it, there was a really terrible rush before the concert and everybody was running around doing something.

You are asking me to choose just 2 activities. It's quite dificult for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot, wich are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if I have to make a choise, I choose climbing and surfing. I'm rather trained in climbing, I have done it once a mounth since I was 17. But in the other hand, I have never done surfing, I am a completely Beginer but I am dieing to do it.###You are asking me to choose just 2 activities.

Anyway, to participate in two-weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A I readily give you my personal details and information. First of all, the most favorable time for me to travel is July, because I am in the final year of University, so I have to attend classes for a thesis almost throughout the year apart from July, when I can take a relatively long summer holiday. Second of all, I would prefer to stay in log cabins to staying in tents, since I have had a horrible experience being attaked by a herd of midges, when I camped out. Additionally, I am very happy to be given the chance to do some activities during the stay. I would willingly like to choose swimming and painting. I used to belong to a swimming club and practise swimming a couple of times a week. I have also gone in for some competitions. Painting is one of my hobbies as well, although I do not specialise in it or anything. I'm looking forward to painting beautiful landscapes of California. Last but not at least, what sort of clothes do you think I must bring with me, and is there any laundry system there? Also should I take some money just in case?###Anyway, to participate in two-weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A I readily give you my personal details and information.

I was at the concert when I met a friend of mine whose job is to organise shows like that. He told me He needed a boy who could help on stage. As you known, I can do a little of everything so I accepted. I connected wires, I caried loudspeakers, and so on.###I was at the concert when I met a friend of mine whose job is to organise shows like that. He told me he needed a boy who could help on stage.

When you go to a sale shop it is dificult to find what you look for without a help of the shop assistant. The problem is find a shop assistant who hear to your problems and can help you. After that you have to wait a long time in the qeue to pay and many times it isn't possible pay with your credit card and you don't have a money in cash. So you had lost hours to buy nothing. You can't talk to the manager even to give him suggestions on how to improve his business, because he is always absent.

Consequently I hope that it is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July, when the company I work with suspends its activities.

I can only travel during July because I have many A-levels examinations to take during June. I would prefer staying in a tent because I haven't done it before and I would like to give it a go.

It was last month that I was selected. I had to help the director writing a script of the concert and design the background of the stage. I have also been told that they were going to make a music video from that concert, so I tried as well as I could. I didn't get involved that much in writing a script because it was very hard and the director wrote most of it but the main idea of the background of the stage was my, and I am very proud of it. Everything has been finally planed two days before the concert.###It was last month that I was selected.

As for the accommodation, I would like to stay in a log cabin because I hate sleeping in the tents. I stayed in a tent once when I had my Duke of Edinburgh walk.

I was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance in last month. At that time, I was so nervous because I did not know what to do. However, I was excited to meet lots of people and the pop star, Kelly Chen. When I first entred the concert hall, I was given a pass for working here. There were five other students, like me, who were waiting to help. We were sitting at the back of the concert hall and chatting with each other. I found that they were all Kelly's fans. We were told that we were responsible for decorating the hall. There were lots of decorations and I had to put the decorations to the right place. It was a tiring work because I had to run from place to place for hanging the decorations. After I had finished my work, I saw Kelly Chen walking into the concert hall. She smiled at me and said thank you to me. I was very happy at that time and I thought it was the happiest moment that I ever had. At last, the concert was started. There were many people at the show and I was sitting on a good seat to watch the concert.###I was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance in last month.

I would like to travel in July to California. The reason is that we have long holidays at school on this time. Although, the accommodation isn't so important for me. I would prefer the log cabin because of the comfort and the better bed.###I would like to travel in July to California. The reason is that we have long holidays at school at that time.

It seems to me that it will be a nice idea to show our library because, according to the librarians, the library has a welcoming atmosphere and is also well-used, moreover the range of books and newspapers is very large and useful.

Firstly, I can only travel on July because that's when I have vacations from school. Secondly, I prefer to stay in a tent. I have stayed in a tents a few times and I have not had any problems.

I also chose Fotography because it is one of my hobbies.

I would like to go in July for it's the only month I can choose. In July I'll be on my vacation. As for accomodation I would prefer to live in tents. In my opinion it's the best way of joining nature and fully enjoying it. I'd be glad to choose painting and singing. And I'm good at both because I used to attend to a painting studio when I was at school. I also used to join the school choir and was one of the best sopranos. So I'd be happy to do the activities on two reasons. First I am good enough at both of them. Secondly I truly love painting and singing.###I would like to go in July because it's the only month I can choose. In July I'll be on my vacation.

I enjoy shopping like any woman. It is amazing and sometimes amuzing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is. And still even this strong spell can be easily shattered. Who can prevent me from having a good, though probably not for my purse, time in the magic world of shopping? The assistant of evil power which frustrates the long-looked-forward-to spell is a shop assistant. Or I would rather say he or she might be or might happen to be such. It's all very nice to be met by a helpful assistant with a radiant smile, ready to help you. But sometimes I really get annoyed at his or her, persistent in nature and polite in structure, questions or suggestions. To say nothing about his or her giving advice! I always make my own decisions! Like any human being I am not delighted to feel guilty, especially when I am not. But I do feel ill at ease when I see dissappointed or angry assistants' faces on leaving the magic world without any remembrances of it!###I enjoy shopping like any woman.

I would be able to travel only in July because it is my summer holiday and I assumed that it will be long enough time to fit the trip in. Also I cannot go on other holidays because for the Easter holiday I need to attend a Tennis competition in the name of my school and we need time to practise. In the Christmas holiday I would like to go back home and be with my family. Also we are going to a ferry trip with my relatives. That are the reasons why I cannot go on your trip at any other times. I do appologize about that.###I will be able to travel only in July because it is my summer holiday and I assumed that it will be long enough time to fit the trip in.

I would like to choose these 2 activities, they are Tennis and Climbing. As I say before, that I have to attend a tennis competition, so I think I am quite good at it. I started playing tennis when I was 9, now I am 18 years old. I was in the tennis county player when I was 12. I attended 15 competitions already. I have lost 5 games and won 10 games. My dad influences me to play tennis and I enjoy it. For climbing, I started to be interested in it since it was 14. My family live near the sea so we have got quite a lot of chance to go climbing. I'm not scared of height and I think it's challenging. My sister loves nature and climbing so she is the one who influences me.###I would like to choose these 2 activities, they are Tennis and Climbing.

As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I like it and get quite good marks for my project, about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether I can be able and willing to help for the concert in two weeks time in the concert hall. I immediately say "yes" and also my friend. I really think it sounds so interesting. I have never done light and sound for the real pop concert before and I think it will be a good experience for me. Actually I've just done light and sound in a drama's day in my school at the end of last term. But this time it'll be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television.###As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I liked it and got quite good marks for my project, about light and sound.

The preperation days came. The first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came. Their jobs are preparing for the concert. I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amuzing! It sounded very interesting to me. Then we started to talk about what we have to do for this concert. I have learnt lots of things about preparing a stage, light, sound, background. I felt like I'm one of those professional too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of thing from doing the practical work. All of them were very nice and friendly. Another exciting part was, I had to climb to put the lights up. Can you imagine the real concert, how high the lights always like? It was good fun though! , but my friend didn't like doing that at all. She didn't seem to enjoyed it as much as I do.###The preparation days came. On the first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came. Their job is to prepare for the concert. I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amazing! It sounded very interesting to me. Then we started to talk about what we had to do for this concert. I have learnt lots of things about preparing a stage, lights, sound and background. I felt like I was one of those professionals too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of things from doing the practical work.

At the end of the day, my ambition is to be like one of the professionals. I really do hope I can be like them. My teacher was very proud of me because after the concert, all the staff were saying how helpful I was and so on. Do you know, my ambition make me to try to work very hard and this term I get A for my art and design. It encouraged me so much and I think I can be good at it, if I keep on working hard. I think the concert has changed me so much, now I have my aim about what I should do in my life.

The pop singer was called Hikaru Utada, she is only seventeen years old but she is the most popular singer now in Japan. The concert was start at 7.00 p.m. At that time I was in the second floor where I had to work is. I did a part of gard job. I stood up in front of the audiences and I had given an attention to them. I couldn't see 'Hikaru' but I still could hear her songs.

Log cabines will be the ideal accomodation, presumably they are more spacious than tent and it would be easier to keep tidy. It's always nice to have a warm, clean place to go to after sailing, which is one of the activities I would like to do. And I'm quite good at it. Climbing would be my second option, but for this I'm afraid I would need some instruction for I've only done it a few times.###Log cabins would be the ideal accommodation.

Of course there was the cooking and bar-tending for anyone who was hungry during the brakes. The hard work, though, started when everyone left at the end of the concert.

First, when I arrived they told me to go to a big room, where the singers try on their clothes and they are made-up. There, in the room I had to helped them, I mean the singers, to put on theirs clothes, and I had to put make-up on them. A few minutes later the show started and the grup appeared on the stage. While they were singing a man told me to clean the room, where the singers get dressed. Later, when the show had finished, I stayed with the grup in their room for a few minutes. Then, they went to the airport, and my dream finished.###First, when I arrived they told me to go to a big room, where the singers try on their clothes and they have their make-up put on.

I can't understand these people because this situation never happen to me. By the way, usually the people that don't like shopping are men or children.

There was a concert of Michael Jackson in my city last month. It was a charity concert, which was organised by a university where I am studying. My classmates and I, we were asked to do decorating the stage, and cleaning the concert's area. But guess, Kim, what was the most exciting thing for us was, we were asked to be the singer's interviewer. spokeperson just asked him a couple of questions behind the stage. I was so nervous that I couldn't remember what to say. If you imagined yourself talking to the most famous pop singer such as him, how would you feel? But what I really enjoyed on that evening was when we took a photographs with him after his concert and he signed it for us on the back side of each picture.###There was a Michael Jackson concert in my city last month.

13.Jun. 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am very pleased to hear that I won the first prize in the competition. It would be great for me to go to the U.S.A as the prize and to stay for two weeks. Below is the information you requested from me. Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have got a prior plan to teach the Korean children in Brighton about Korean and Korean history in the early August. Secondly, I would like to stay at log cabins which would have a good smell of nature in them. Also if I have to choose two of the activities, I would like to play tennis and to go surfing because playing tennis is my first choice and I am very good at it. And also the reason why I would like to go surfing is that I am always dreaming of surfing on the coast of California like on TV, but I have never tried to surf yet, which doen't mean I am bad at swimming. Finally, I would like you to let me know which clothes would be suitable for the weather at that time and how much money I should take. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Haneul Gay Kay.###13.Jun. 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am very pleased to hear that I won the first prize in the competition.

In addition to this, even if you buy something you would like, you can change your mind at home.

So let's answer the question you told me to in order to make that two weeks there as much funnier as possible. You asked me when would I like to travel to California. Definitely, in July. That's my only month for holidays in the whole year. If possible, I'd like to spend my time there in a tent. I hope just the sleeping one. That's the best suitable accomodation for a camping holiday. It just keeps you in touch with nature. That's what camping is about, isn't it? I've found the list of activities you sent me very interesting. If I have to choose two of them I'll take tennis first. I'm an expert on it and I'll have a good time beating everyone there. Can't say the same about golf. It will be my first experience with the putt. I just hope not to get injured. One thing you have not told me is weather I have to pay for all things by my own in California or not. Please, let me know.###So let's answer the question you asked me to in order to make those two weeks there as much fun as possible. You asked me when I would like to travel to California.

One thing you have not told me is whether I have to pay for everything myself in California or not. Please, let me know.
Any way, it was a great experience and I enjoy it very much. The part I enjoyed most was the one when they paid me. It wasn't much but that means nothing when you have the chance to take part in an event like that. They also gave me a ticket to wotch the concert live. Great show.###Anyway, it was a great experience and I enjoyed it very much. The part I enjoyed most was the one when they paid me.

The only one term for me to visit you is July. I can come to USA on July becouse on August I will be working with my father. We are building a new house for our family. What about accommodation, I prefer tents to log cabins. Nights in hol. on July are hot. Tent will be more cooler to sleep in then the cabin.###The only one time for me to visit you is July.

Shoping is not always enjoyable.###Shopping is not always enjoyable.
Ten or fifteen years ago we had in Poland empty shelves in shops. We could only buy things from Russia. People alwas queued for stuff from the west. If you had wanted something special for example for a gift you had to stay in a line all night. It was the worst side of shopping in Poland a couple of years ago. Nowadays we have capitalism, free market, lots of privete shops, markets and super-markets. We can buy everything what about we imagine. Polish super market are not Polish origin shops. They are imported from enother Western Europe country.###Ten or fifteen years ago we had empty shelves in shops in Poland. We could only buy things from Russia.

The statement mentioned is perfectly suitable to my opinion. If you want to buy new clothes for summer the biggest difficulty is to find a shop, which sells what you are looking for.

It's a big advantage to go shopping with a friend, because he or she can bring you all the clothes in a suitable size if the one you took doesn't fit.

First of all, if you want to buy nice dresses, the first thing you have to do is looking around all the shops and department stores in a city. If you are lucky enough, you might find them within 30 minutes, but if you don't, you might have to keep walking for several hours and still couldn't find ones!! That's would be so exhausting.###First of all, if you want to buy nice dresses, the first thing you have to do is look around all the shops and department stores in a city.

Next thing you have to do is trying them on. You have to be patient enough to tolerate long queues for fitting rooms.

There was a large stage which we had to clean by sweeping. That was a little bit odd but and funny at the same time. Another thing we had to do was help the staff to tranfer some equipment. The musicians brough it in order to achieve a high standard of quality sound. We had to be very careful. Have you any idea how much does this stuff is worth? You don't even want to know.###There was a large stage which we had to sweep clean. That was a little bit odd but and funny at the same time.

Even if I could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that I've gained through it! I've learned the meaning of the words "reliability" and "responsibility". Anyway the result of the whole preparation is  far more enjoyable and relaxing.###Even if I could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that I gained from it!

The shopping is great when you have lots of moneys, and times; you can buy clothes, shoes, make-up; CD, whatever. But, it's not easy for workers, because the shops close their doors about 5.30 pm (half past five). When you work in a office, a manufactory, a society, you have the same planning to them. So you just can go to do a shopping during your lunch break. If not, you can go the Saturdays but it's badly, because there are too many costumers. You can't walk, or try clothes on, and it's very hot. The salewomen are too busy and haven't a moment for give you a counsil service.###Shopping is great when you have lots of money, and time; you can buy clothes, shoes, make-up; CDs, whatever.

We have a few possibilities. We can look up a magazine or a booklet which deliver with the newspaper weekly. We can order a free book from big shops or companies monthly.

The second kind of shopping is not enjoyable. It is when you have to buy what is necessary for you: bread, butter, milk etc... It is always the same. You have to find the best article for the best price. You are among thousands of people, but, at the same time, you are alone. Besides, when you want to pay for the things you have taken, you can believe that the ladies behind the cashdesks are unable to smile. After that, you have to carry your bag (of course far too heavy for you) to your car. When you are at home, there is no reward except that your husband or your children notice that the fridge is full again.###The second kind of shopping is not enjoyable.

I suggest to film our English lessons and Math lessons. From the activities I suggest to film sport lessons. and music lessons. We have very interesting English lessons. They are always funny and nice. We always learn something new. At some lessons students are always work, but us we work, we joke, discuss many topics, tell some stories about our life. Students think that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything spessial. It's not true. We practice our English and I think we have to film our English lessons, so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way how they do. Also Math. lessons are so interesting. Many people don't like Math because they think that it's a boreing subject. I think it's all depends of the teacher. Our Math. teacher knows how to teach so we don't get tired of his lessons. I think we should film the Math. lessons, so students and some teachers will change their opinion about Math. For activities, we should film sport lessons because we always do something new. We do many competitions with other schools, and we always have fun. Our music lessons are speccial. We try to play on many instruments, and sing even if we don't know how. And it's always interesting to wach others while they do something like that.###I suggest filming our English lessons and Maths lessons.

Well, in my point of view the most interesting lessons that we do at school but which in real life are useful, are maths because everything we do is all about maths. The other lesson that I think is very important is physics because of the same reason as maths. On the other hand I think that geography is important as well because we must all know WHERE we live, what are the problems that we have in this world, what problem does every different country have and where does the petroleum come from and what are the advantages and disadvantages for using it and about the gold as well, there are loads of thinks about geography that we MUST KNOW.###Well, from my point of view the most interesting lessons that we have at school and which are useful in real life, are maths because everything we do is all about maths.

I also have some enquiries concerning the trip. I would like to know what the weather would be like at that time of the year so I am able to pack the essential clothings.

I would say window shopping is the reason why I have no money now. Sometime last month, I was just the same as I am now, with no money.

When we went into the first shop, I caught sight of a long black dress. As I had nothing better to do, I tried it on. I fell in love with it.

First of all, we cleared all the seats. There were so many seats that it took a long time to finish clearing. Before the concert started, we sold some snacks and drinks and after that, we stood in front of the audience to prevent them from moving forward. During the concert, all the fans try to get closer to the singers, jumping, shouting and so on and some of them faint when they get to excited. We move them to a safe place so that they won't be kicked or stepped on by other mad fans.###First of all, we cleared all the seats.

People often have very different opinions about shopping. Most women and girls like it, especially when they want to buy clothes and shoes. A man usually is less interested in shopping, maybe because he frequently has to pay for what his wife has bought.###People often have very different opinions about shopping.

In my opinion, shopping can be interesting in big stores, where you can find everything, or in shops which sell something special or strange. On the contrary, I don't like going to shops where you see only common things, and I hate it when there is a lot of crowd. In this case, you have to stay in long queues, you can't walk without being pulled or pushed, and you often have to spend a hour to buy some soap or a packet of biscuits. Even if you are with a friend, you can't talk, because of the noise and the confusion, and you may find it difficult also to walk close to each other.###In my opinion, shopping can be interesting in big stores, where you can find everything, or in shops which sell something special or strange.

Generally I paint some landscapes by using the watercolours, but sometimes I try to paint like during the impresionist era by using blobs, oil paint and canvases.###I see people who run the camp are very good at organizing the social life of their guests.

Sometimes, unfortunatelly shopping could be very annoying, especially at Christmast or Easter time. Then, all shops and supermarkets are crowded. People are trying to buy as many things as they can, and everyone wants to be first to the check-out - you have to wait ages to get there! People are pushing each other, they are not as kind as usually. You have to be more careful and hold your bag tightly because this is a good period for all thieves (they know they can steal something without having been seen!) At Christmas or Easter time all shops have usuallyly have an unpleasant smell (because of the crowd) and are very noisy!###Sometimes, unfortunately shopping can be very annoying, especially at Christmas or Easter time.

Next, another not very enjoyable thing about shopping is spending money! When I go to the big supermarkets I always spend more than I was going to. You just cannot refuse buying another bottle of body lotion or another box of soap because they smell so nice can you?! I always become very angry with myself afterwards, but I cannot help it.###Next, another not very enjoyable thing about shopping is spending money!

In my opinion, shopping could be really enjoyable! The only advice would be: "Do not do your shopping at Christmast or Easter time" - but it will not make any sense, will it?

First of all I would like to travel in July. I think that this is the most ideal month for a trip to California. This period the days are sunny and the weather won't prevent me from doing a lot of activities. About the accomodation I would prefer to stay in a cabin. I think that the combins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the weather changes. The two activities I have chosen is swimming and climbing. I selected swimming because this is one of my hobbies and I'm good enough t this sector. In addition I would like to swim in a sea like California's because it is clean and beautiful. I chose climbing because I'm intrested in this sport even if I'm not experienced. I like it because it offers you a lot of adventure and action.###First of all I would like to travel in July.

As you asked me I will write to you about the experience I had helping at the pop concert. All the children helped as much as they could and that's why the result was beautiful enough. Before the concert I helped in carring and putting in order some chairs on which would sit some special persons. It was very hard and at the end I was very tired. At the concert, what I had to do was to give out refreshments and drinkings to the audience. I also helped to clear up the place after the concert.###As you asked me I will write to you about the experience I had helping at the pop concert.

In addition I had the opportunity to talk to the singers and have a lot of autogrammes by them.

Secondly, I would prefer living in tents, I always admire outdoors life. Finally, I would like to do surging and golf.

Anyway, the most important thing was that I had a good experience. If we had worked together we would have had a good time. It's  a pity, isn't it?

I can sleep in a tent, it would remain me of a good time which I'd spent with my friends a few years ago. I'm not scared of darkness, rain, cold or hot whether.

At first I was helping to seill the tickets - it wasn't difficult. Anyway, four hours, before the concert had started, I was helping with the lights. We had to check evey plug, switch, lights.

According to your letter, I have two options of accommodation, or in tents or log cabins. I would prefer in tents because I think that is something more exciting and new for me. I never stayed in a tents in the middle of nowhere, in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new. Log cabins may be more confortable, on the other hand I think that I will be able to "survive" in a tents. Looking to your letter, I can see many options of activities and I realized that I like most of them. I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting. The reason of choosing this two activities is that they contrast with itselves, I want one that is more exciting and that asks for more agility and another that is more calm and relaxing, that asks only for my ability to paint. Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good on that, however, I wish that I can learn about it on the Camp. Painting is something that I love and I am very good doing it.###According to your letter, I have two options regarding accommodation, either in tents or log cabins.

Basketball and swimming I think are the best for the children. Basketball will help the children to build team character and leadership skills. And swimming is very good for their health. I swim really good and I am a proffesional basketball player. I count on my experience.###Basketball and swimming I think are the best for the children.

I have got very responsible work. I had to bring food for Peter Bolen and Tomas Anders. Can you imagine? I came into their room and give hot Cheeseburgers, Coca-Cola and ice-cream to Peter. It was the happiest moment of my life. He asked me was the cheeseburger hot and I answered that it was. I was very nervous talking with him. He told me about a concert programme and gave me his photo with a sign.###I had taken on very demanding work. I had to bring food for Peter Bolen and Tomas Anders. Can you imagine?

Firstly, I can travel only in July because I have no time except in July as I am a postgraduate student. I would very much like to stay in a log cabin. I think it is a wonderful idea to stay in a tent only for a few days but not over 3 days. It will be more comfortable to stay in a log cabin.###Firstly, I can only travel in July because I have no time except in July as I am a postgraduate student.

Regarding with two activities, I will choose swimming and photography. I am not good at swimming but I would very much like to learn how to swim this year. On the other hand, I am very good at photography as I was a photographer in a club while I was in the college.###Regarding with two activities, I will choose swimming and photography.

Lastly I would particularly like to know about clothes and money. Isn't it cold at night in the Camp California? I like ice cram, sweets and beverage very much, especially in the summer. Are these expensive? Could you please tell me about these? I am looking forward to your reply.###Lastly I would particularly like to know about clothes and money.

On the other hand, it usually take much time to get what you exactly want. Because you have to visit many shops and see many thing. If the shopping mall is not collected, it is physically hard to get what you want. It's not easy to shop with someone who are not interested in shopping.###On the other hand, it usually takes a lot of time to get exactly what you want, because you have to visit many shops and see many things.

In conclusion, shopping is not always enjoyable as many people think. It depends on the situation.

I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time. I would prefer the accommodation at Camp California in tents because it would be nice to spend the time living in tents with a nice environment and fresh air. Also I would like to do two activities while I am at the Camp, which are swimming and photography. Photography is quite interesting for me; I like to take a photograph in the place where I have never been to before. Swimming is quite a nice activity to relax and work out. It is really enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming.###I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time.

Anyway, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. I and my friend - Emma, we helped to paint the scence of the background on the stage. As you known, I like drawing and painting when I have a free time so that is why I chose to paint the scence of the background. I really enjoyed painting it and it looked very nice. And I particularly liked the experience that I helped to screen and paint a picture of "Bon Jovi" on every T-shirts which are given to the audiences. I felt that it was a great time in my life.###Anyway, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. I and my friend - Emma, we helped to paint the scenery of the background on the stage.

Firstly, I would like to answer your questions. As I am doing my A-levels exams at the moment and they continue until the 30th of June and my further studies start in August, I can only travel in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent. It will give me an adventure feeling and I have always prefered tents to log cabins. I enjoy basketball very much and I am quite good at it. I would like to play this game at your camp. I have never tried out climbing, but I have always wished to do it one day. Would it be possible to do this activity at your camp as a beginner?###Firstly, I would like to answer your questions.

You asked me to wite about my experience which I made by helping at the pop-concert. And I can say it was terrific! My job was actually to listen to Tim and do whatever he said. This included to clean up the rooms which were used by the singers and put some equipment on the stage. Tim was in charge of organising this concert. I had never been behind the stage before and you know the rooms, in which singers dress and apply make-up, are actually small. Can you imagine, I could stay at this concert without paying anything! And I managed to speak to Ricky Martin out of stage. O.K., I actually asked him only: 'How are you?' and he gave me his signature. He was fantastic, you know that he is my favourite singer. I think this was my best job as a student in Cambridge. Probably it wasn't so nice to do jobs which you were told to do, but you see many stars out of stage. And you might manage to speak to some pop-stars. Beside this, I earned some money, not a lot but enough for me.###You asked me to write about the experience which I had by helping at the pop-concert.

For activities, my first choise is basketball. I have been playing it since I was nine years old.

When I arrived there, the staff were already busy. At first I just helped setting up the stage; setting microphones, and tuning guiters. When I was doing it, one of the staff called me and brought me to a room. He explained to me that it was to controll the light. It was fun practicing how to move the lights and change the lights.

Money is a very important thing in shopping, if you have money, it is not a problem, but if you don't?

I think the result of that action was marvelous. Everybody was very suprise that you can create such amazing things, using a sizors and papers. I like a lot the mountains which I made. From the distance they looked very real. I just rulled a paper and I painted a little white colours on the top. In front of the stage I put the grass and a lot of flowers. The light on the stage was very bright and very warm what's made the scenery very pleasent.###I think the result of that action was marvellous.

First of all, I think that I help them. Every day of that month I was trying to advertise this concert. I was going to markets and to schools and I was giving out information about when and where the group was going to appear as well as where can they buy or book a ticket for this concert. I know, It was difficult and tired but I enjoyed it a lot. Firstly, it was a good break from the usual routine. Because I did it for the first time. Also, I felt wonderful when I saw, that the concert had a succesed and every day it was croweded. Because I believed that this was a result which came about with my help. I would like to do again it in the future. It was a fantastic experience.###First of all, I think that I helped them. Every day of that month I was trying to advertise this concert.

1. The fully-equipped computer centre in the main building is extremelly good. Lessons are very interesting and full of fun. Our teacher is friendly and he encourages us to study well. However, there are no enough computers and sometimes we have to study in pairs. I suggest to increase the number of them, because it will be more exiting to film.###1.

2. The school arranges an amasing range of activities, such as excuintions, sports and different kinds of trips.

Secondly, the cost is also a problem. It will be really an annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it. One of my friend, Emma, happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs £105. Then she spent all her spare time doing part-time jobs to earn money. After a week, she had got enough money and rushed to that shop. But it was just not there! She felt really badly after that. So, would you still say that shopping is enjoyable?###Secondly, the cost is also a problem. It is a really annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it.

There are many things that can go wrong in the process of adquiring a product or service. And whenever money is involved, some problems are likely to happen.

Hunting on the High Street, or the Shopping Malls, for the desired bargain - because we cant afford otherwise to buy anything - becomes often a desperate atempt to reach a living promoted by the new consuming society. And nobody can say they would rather go back to the caverns' age where money was not even invented.###Hunting on the high street, or the shopping malls, for the desired bargain - because we can't afford anything - often becomes a desperate attempt to attain a lifestyle promoted by the new consumerist society.

I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the Californiai summer is hot and dry so, because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a confortable coolness. The two activities I would like to do are basketball and surfing. I have played basketball during 5 years in an amateur franchise and still play on a playground regularly so my skills are good. On the other hand, I am a complete debutant concerning surfing. This sport has always attracted me due to its contact with the sea and the great sensations it provides and I believe this is the perfect occasion to initiate myself to the exciting sport, I still have some questions to ask you:###I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the Californian summer is hot and dry so, because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a comfortable coolness.

You often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the alleys to take a look at a product. After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is out of price. Frustrated, you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers. There, you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to stay up even though your tired legs demand a seat. It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the hypocrital cashier.###You often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the aisles to take a look at a product.

Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer but, unluckily, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends and I also like swimming. When I was in primary school, I was one of the members in the swimming-school team. I am not really good at basketball but I think it is a good fun. Because of these reasons, I choose basketball and swimming from the list which I were given.###In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends and I also like swimming.

The best dates for me to travel, would be in July because actually I work in the communication firm and I must ask to my employer when I can take holidays. But I think it will be from the 7 July 2000 to the 21 July 2000. For the accommodation at camp, I prefer in the log cabins, because a few years go, I went camping with some friends and every night it rained and in the tent, it was impossible to sleep because the ground was so wet so for this fact, I choose the log cabins.###The best dates for me to travel, would be in July because actually I work in the communications industry and I must ask to my employer when I can take holidays.

There were maybe 50,000 spectators for this show, it was amazing. When the concert started I had to look round if anybody threw bottles or something else on the scene. I also helped to serve people who would like drink, I was like a barman.

First of all, I would like to express my joy for having won that prize. I am very happy. Secondly, you would like to know when I will be able to go there.

I think it is more fun. Concerning the activities, I would choose tennis and sailing. I am very good at tennis. Last year, I took part in a competition and I did it well. I have also a licence for sailing but I have not done it for a long time. I need to know what kind of clothes I should take with me. I do not know if things are expensive there.

We have more and more shops everywhere and they sale everything. Because of that, people's need has increase a lot nowadays. It is also the reason why we have all these new supermarkets. In the one hand, it is very enjoyable to go shopping because we can find a lot of things. Sometimes we need them and sometimes we don't but it is fun to buy new clothes, furniture and so one.

First of all, I would like to travel in July because I am planning to visit my Mum in Korea in August. I also prefer staying in log cabins to tents. I have once experienced to have been soaked while I was sleeping in a tent dut to heavy rain several years ago. Once more reason is that I do not want to miss the chance to stay in a log cabin, which I have been dreaming of for a long time. How romantic it will be! As for my activities, as I took up playing golf since I was a child and now, I am a single-handicapped player, so I want to have a chance to play golf at camp. Moreover, I am very good at singing as well as playing the piano. In fact I have been playing the piano for a children's choir for 5 years.###First of all, I would like to travel in July because I am planning to visit my Mum in Korea in August.

As you know, I've not been keen on pop music - I've always thought it was not only noisy but also even rubbish. It was not until the concert that I became a pop mania. It was really great to have talked with famous pop singers, bands, and TV stars. When a member of Venga boys came to the emergency center for the treatment of an electric shock on his finger, I felt I was short of breath. We usually are apt to think famous stars to be arrogant and nasty, but they weren't at all. It was absolutely our prejudice. They were very kind, soft, well-behaved, even modest. Their attitudes towards people, their costumes, their songs - everything was really fantastic. Fortunately there were few emergency accident so I could enjoy the concert without a hurry. I was definitely over the moon!###As you know, I've not been keen on pop music - I've always thought it was not only noisy but also even rubbish.

The second thing I like about shopping is the possibility to find your own style by buying clothes in the small boutiques. You can always ask for good advice from the experienced shop attendants, which does not necessarily cost you extra money. However, someone else may say, it takes too much time.###The second thing I like about shopping is the possibility to find your own style by buying clothes in the small boutiques.

I was few of the lukiest people from my school to be picked up to help at the pop concert which took place in my town. The organiser of the concert asked my school for about 15 people, who does art, to help decorate the stage. Me and my friends were very excited, not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop sigers and bands whom we will be able to see! Everyone was so jealous in the school.###I was one of the luckiest people from my school to be picked up to help at the pop concert which took place in my town.

When we got there, there were very many people. People were carrying big boxes around which contained electrical equipments for the concert. We were all given different sort of jobs to do. Some of us had to paint and some of us had to cut some materials and fabrics out into special shapes. It was very interesting and we enjoyed doing it very much. However the best part was watching and listening to the singers and bands practicing on the stage. At the end we were given free concert tickets and got autobiographies from our favourite pop singers.###When we got there, there were very many people.

But the question is: Why shopping is not always enjoyable?. For many people, shopping had always been only for one kind of elite, or social class; not all people can go shopping and buy hundreds and thousands of stuff in those big malls as a distraction.

Why do people like shopping? First answer is that they need to go shopping. Second answer is that the shopping makes everyone happy. If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel like going shopping. When I do shopping I don't think about any problems I have. It's very relaxing for me but only if it is possible to do the shopping. Sometimes it can be nightmare if you can't find something that you are looking for.###Why do people like shopping?

On the one hand, a big problem are the children.

Secoundly, I would be very grateful if you can accommodate me in tents rather than long cabins. It is mostly because I like fresh air at night.

I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June, so I can only travel in July. I wonder if it is all right for that time. And for my accommodation.

Unfortunately, the only month I can travel is July because I'm doing my final exams at university in June and then starting a job in August. Any two weeks during July will suit me perfectly.

I'd just like to know if the tents at the camp are based on sharing and how many people is there in one tent.###Unfortunately, the only month I can travel is July because I'm doing my final exams at university in June and then starting a job in August.

I really appreciate the choice of activities at the camp. It was hard to choose only two. I've chosen tennis and sailing. I've played tennis since I was eight years old and I'm very good at it. I'm also good at swimming and surfing but I'd like to try sailing. I was always attracted to it but never had an opportunity to try.

In my last letter I promised to write to you about my experience working at a pop-concert.

The concert was due to start at 7 o'clock but we had to be there two hours before the beginning. First I was supposed to help at the refreshment spot for the fans but some 15 minutes before beginning I was told to go to the backstage and help with the refreshment for the musicians, technicians and others who worked there. It was very hectic there as everyone was a bit nervous but I saw the main stars and even managed to talk to them.###The concert was due to start at 7 o'clock but we had to be there two hours before the beginning.

When they started to play I was told to change my post again. This time I was helping the medical workers who had full hands with fainted teenage girls. First, it seemed to me odd because I didn't understand why they faint, but as the concert went on, the heat in the air was increasing and so was the number of the fainted. It wasn't funny anymore and I didn't know what to do first. I was really shocked by the view of crying and shaking but absolutely happy girls sitting or lying on the floor.###When they started to play I was told to change my post again.

As you know, I helped at a pop concert last month, I did things as unusual in me as cleaning instruments, organise people, and also look after the clothes of the artists.

Nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that, to do so, you do not need to make any effort. strengh that practising a sport or even going to work require, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money.###Nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that, to do so, you do not need to make any effort. strength that doing a sport or even going to work requires, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money.
However, this apparently quite and relaxed activitie can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy by the mixture of smells that come from the people. Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her.###However, this apparently quiet and relaxed activity can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy with the mixture of smells that come from the people.

I'm writing to you to tell you about a pop concert that happend here in São Rafael. Red Hot Chilli Pepers came here for a short time and they played at the "Chedicard Hall". It was realy cool because I did some backstage job. I helped with the clothing, with some paperwork, with the microphones, with the computers. I was everywher. I was kind of a "handy girl". I did a little bit of everything.. The best part was when the band arrived. I took lots of pictures, asked for authographs and I even gave them my cel phone number! They promissed me that they would call me some day, what I particulary doubt. Some thing that was also great was to watch the show from the back stage. It's an unique experience. I wished you could be there with me.###I'm writing to you to tell you about a pop concert that happened here in São Rafael.

I am a member in the council team so I decided to help them at a pop concert that was organized in the last month. I helped them to prepare the room for the bads and I decorated the place for the singers. Also, I assisted them to choose the right instruments and to test them. It took a long time to testifite the speakers and the microphones. Unless this preparation, I also took part to the concert. I helped them to  the music and to the songs. It was a quite difficult assiment but I got some very good experience. I understood it when the concert had finished. The audients was excited and I cannot discribe my happyness. It was some thing that I didn't expect. Also, it happen the first time in my life. I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were accompaning our songs. I enjoyed it very much and I want to tranfere my enjoyment to you though this letter.###I am a member of the council team so I decided to help them at a pop concert that was organized in the last month.

The concert was absolute marvellous! So many happy people in the crowds, that the atmosphere was infectious. Anyway, what you wanted to know was what has been my job.

I was a little bit disappointed about their attitude. They didn't really appreciate my service. Some of them were quite rude. Apart from that, it was an amazing experience.

It was terrible! We have a lot of problems from the beggining. The first one was the security. People in charge of security didn't arrive when they were supposed to. If it weren't a calm and quite public, we would have had troubles. Another problem was the band. They didn't want to play until the room were crowded. So that concert started an hour and a half latter.###It was terrible! We had a lot of problems from the beginning. The first one was the security.

Everything was all right during the perform of the band, but at the end some espectators came up to the stage and made some damage to the band's instrument. The singer and the guitarist were so angry that they went out immediately, leaving the public without the last part of the show.###Everything was all right during the performance, but at the end some spectators came up on the stage and did some damage to the band's instruments.

As you can see, hardly anything went well, but the lights and the sound - for both in wich I helped carrying things - were appropriate for the concert. Althought all these things, I gained a lot of experience and I could be near one of my favourite pop stars, which was the better experience I've ever had.###As you can see, hardly anything went well, but the lights and the sound - for both of which I helped carry things - were appropriate for the concert.

Last month was amazing for me, I was helping at a pop concert.

We arrived at the stadium the previous evening. The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help in anything they needed done.

They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenary was being prepared for the concert.###We arrived at the stadium the evening before.

The first one is that the band I have helped, although it hasn't met success yet, is really good. When they are on stage, during the repetitions, they are able to play a music that completely moves me. In a few months, when they are famous, I could say: "You know. I already know them, I have even helped them at one of their concert."###The first one is that the band I have helped, although it hasn't found success yet, is really good.

Moreover, the work I've had to do, apart from carrying material, was essentially to sell tickets for the concert, which has allowed me to meet a lot of nice people and to become friend with some of them.

On the other hand, when you go with someone else shopping, and you both want to see and buy different things, it can also be boring and uninteresting. Then it is perhaps better, when you make an appointment in one hour and everybody enjoys the shopping alone.###On the other hand, when you go shopping with someone else, and you both want to see and buy different things, it can also be boring.

According to the activities, I would love to play basketball. I'm used to playing it, and I'm quite a good player. The other activities don't appeal to me much, but I'm quite good at Golf.

Last month, I helped at a pop concert by chance. I have just worked as a normal worker but I have met so many famous singers who I ever seen on TV. Of course, I could listen to all their music, which were so cool. After the concert I had got an opportunity to join them to the party. The best thing was that I have learned how to control their expensive instruments and I have sung my favorite songs with them.###Last month, I helped at a pop concert by chance.

In other hand, after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card. For instance, you want to buy everything which you saw, and after that, you don't know how much you have spent. If you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet which you are looking at some interesting things. It will be very awful.###On the other hand, after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card.

I think the people who are enjoying shopping they are greede for materialistic things and they havn't any interests for the spirit (?), in the intelect life. They are loosing time of their life for nothing. In my opinion we must spend more time for more interesting than shopping things, like sport, reading, chating about ideas which make our lives better. We must do something for help other people to feel better and be usefull.###I think the people who enjoy shopping they are greedy for materialistic things and they haven't any interests in the spirit (?), in the intellect life.

Dear Madam Ryan,###Dear Ms Ryan,
At the Camp I want to live in a log cabin. I do not like the tents; one can find insects in them and they are not as comfortable as log cabins.###At the Camp I want to stay in a log cabin. I do not like the tents; one can find insects in them and they are not as comfortable as log cabins.

I would try to do some painting, too, but I have never painted.###For the two activities I can choose, I would like to play tennis: I have some experience of this sport, because I played tennis for seven years and it is still my favourite activity.

It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp. As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in them. I came second in last year's swimming competition and I have enrolled in photography classes.

Couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend, who is into music, and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing. She invited me to the rehearsal of a huge consert whose singer who was a well-known pop star as well as my favorite. Can you believe that I was introduced to him and I took numerous photographs, some of which I put in the envelope. It was like a dream come true, and was the best part of the experience in my opinion. I helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments. Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget througout my whole life###A couple of days ago I bumped into my best friend, who is into music, and we started to have a chat about what we had both been doing.

First of all, I would like to know if you have some vacancies in July because it is the only month where I am in holidays. About the accommodation, I would prefer staying in a tents as I used to during summer holidays when I was a child. Furthermore, you asked me to choise two activities I would like to do. Firstly, I will be happy to play tennis because I used to play this sport with my village club for five years and earned a few competitions. Secondly, I am very interesting in photography because my father is a photographer and we are used to spending time each other. We had a lot of fun during our last holidays and we took a lot of pictures. As the instructions about clothes and money were not enclosed in your letter, I request about it and ask you to include in it.###First of all, I would like to know if you have some vacancies in July because it is the only month where I am on holiday.

For people who used to do shopping, going in big stores, I think they like it and it they are always looking for fashioned-clothes. But when these stores are full of people, crowded, like during the sales period, I am sure that the same people who like doing shopping may think it can be boring.###For people who are used to do shopping, going in big stores, I think they like it and it they are always looking for fashionable clothes.

In my opinion, I think people have to do shopping even though they don't appreciate it very much. If these people have a family with children, they must buy some food to feed them even if a supermarket is full of people. And now for them shopping can be considerated like a contrariety.###In my opinion, I think people have to go shopping even though they don't like it very much.

But, sometimes, go shopping can have other effects on you. It can stress you. For example, when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around. When you can't find what you are looking for anywhere. When you buy something you were looking for a long time and, when you arrive at home, you discover some deffect on it and have to go back to the store to complain.

I really recomend you to help them, I think this is a good oppotunity and I want you understand my feeling well. I've got lots of things about the concert to talk to you about.

I applied to the job and she selected me between hundreds of candidates (I don't receive any salary). My work is to help her during each concert.

I think all people like shopping. When you ask some people to learn their opinions about shopping they can tell you they don't like shopping but I suppose it is not true. For example me, when someone asked me about shopping I would say that I hadn't liked it. However, now if someone asks me the same question my answer will be, "yes, I like it". When people hear this word shopping they only think about to go to some stores and try on new clothes or shoes and search for their size and so on. They don't think about other kind of shopping which are liked by themselves. Maybe they like shopping on the internet or window shopping; it doesn't matter what kind of shopping they like. There are a lot of shopping style on the world. I am sure everybody prefer one of them.###I think all people like shopping.

If I get two choices, I would like to go swimming and take photographs. Because I grew up in my home town that is a seaside city. I was starting trainning since 1996, and I have never give it up. Esepically, it is really good for my healthy during the growth period. Photography is my hobby that is taken in my spare time. I can remember that I used to take photographs on the exhibitions or during the holidays. It must be nice for my memories when I am older. In addition, it could showed people how nice the places I have been are and the views I have got. Therefore, I would like to do those two activities.###If I get two choices, I would like to go swimming and take photographs.

Shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands. There are more and more retailors are opening to customer. Therefore, people used to shopping weekly or monthly.###Shopping is concerned that people exchange from money to their demands. There are more and more retailers are opening to customer.

In my opinion, women are really enjoying shopping. It seems a human activity during their spare time. However, we are going to change from the traditional system to the "e-shopping". It is new for customers by technology they can switch on the computer and click everything they want. Therefore, it looks like a service and is also boring for the customer. I think most of gentlemen dislike shopping. They are always waiting for a long time after women finish their shopping.###In my opinion, women really enjoy shopping.

There were about a hundred people that wanted to help, but only two would be chosen. When they said my name, I couldn't believe it!

Then I'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California. I think sleeping in a tent is funnier than others . However, during my stay at Camp, there are two activities I can choose, for one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most, I and my friend used to win the first place in the school-wide match when we was in school. And for the other one, I think painting will be a good idea; Painting is one of my hobbies and I've been learning it since I was 5 years old and now I'm still doing it once I have some free time.###Then I'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California.

The place where we worked was a football pitch; we spent 3 days on setting up the stage, the equitment, and the lights. In fact, there is nothing very important I did, because we are not the right people to do it.

As for selecting two activities, basketball and surfing are definitely on my list. I spend one third of my spare time playing basketball. As a result, I have an important position in our local basketball team. Surfing was a fresh sport to me which I took up recently. It is really fasinating to challenge the waves. I wish I could learn more so that I could enjoy it more in the future.###As for selecting two activities, basketball and surfing are definitely on my list.

A few minutes after the concert began, a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking wether everything is going well according to the timetable, if something comes up, she should inform the other staff. I was then taken in to cover her job. I couldn't find my feet at first as I was so nervous. I was given lots of paper with many different time on it. I did manage to "study" them though, thanks to the other staff. They were very helpful and nice. They patiently explained to me my job even so they were fairly busy themselves. Then I found it was not as complicated as I though before. And I guess I did a good job as everything was getting on quite well.###A few minutes after the concert began, a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking whether everything was going well according to the timetable.

I saw all the members of the band backstage, how did they change their make-up, hairstyle etc. They were even talking jokes with me and other staff. I was impressed when they kept saying "thank-you" to the staff. Indeed, they can not succeed without their help, can they?

First I would like to say that doing a video about daily life at our school is a great idea. Some people may think that school is boring and nothing interesting ever happens there. I hope that after seeing this video most people will change their view on that topic. To make that happen, we have to find some interesting activities to film.###First I would like to say that making a video about daily life at our school is a great idea.

Last month I went to help at a pop concert where Rolling Stones were playing. It was a wonderful experience but at the same time I had to work very hard. The things I did were: Prepearing and controling the equipment, I had to clean all the stadium, make sure that all the lights were in perfect condition, that the singers were confortable and relaxed, etc.###Last month I went to help at a pop concert where Rolling Stones were playing.

,,Shopping is not always enjoyable". From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not. It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money on our bank account. Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable. Luckily, I'm one of these people. First of all, shopping is a waste of time. People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy. During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area. I just can't understand people who, with a smile on their faces, spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things. They are ready to sacrifise all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jelous.###,,Shopping is not always enjoyable".

Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent. It will let me get up and close with nature, and experience life in the wild. Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember.###Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent.

Last before least, I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America. As I have not been there before, I am rather unsure of what to wear.

In the first place, some housewifes don't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second. To make matters worse, you realise you forget to buy something when you get back home. It is very frustrating. Moreover, if you go with your children, you will have to control them and remember things on your list at the same time and sometimes they cry when they want something in the supermarket. It is a tough chore!###In the first place, some housewives don't like to go to the supermarket because it is not fun to go shopping with a long list and decide which one is the first and the second.

Another point of view against shopping is a lack of the items that you really want. Sometimes when you meet a nice dress and you think you are going to buy it tomorrow but when you come back it is sold out or there is no in your size left. I cannot imagine anything worse.###Another argument against shopping is the lack of the items that you really want.

The other disadvantage is that you enjoy going shopping too much and pay for everything you buy on your credit card. When a bill comes to £1000, you would be shocked and regret what you had done.###The other disadvantage is that you enjoy going shopping too much and pay for everything you buy on your credit card.

In conclusion, I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidently meet a bad situation or you can not control your expenditure carefully.###In conclusion, I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidentally get into a bad situation or you cannot control your expenditure carefully.

I would like to travel at the end of July. In June I have other arrangements, such as my school exams and my birthday. It is convenient for me the last two weeks of July.

During my time in California, I would love to have the chance of some leisure activities such as swimming. It is my favourite sport. I am good and fast at swimming. Another sport I love is basket ball. Hopefull I will meet some other girls interested in the same sport. So we all play as a team.###During my time in California, I would love to have the chance to do some leisure activities such as swimming. It is my favourite sport. I am good at swimming and fast.

My final question is this. Can you let me know if there is any facilities for washing my clothes? If not I will bring with me enough to last for two weeks. Please give me a rough idea how much spending money I will need.###My final question is this. Can you let me know if there are any facilities for washing my clothes?

As a housewife I have a good idea about it. Once a week I go shopping. Sometimes I go two days. We all have to do our shopping. It is unavoidable.

I often shop with no problems, but on Saturday it is not the same. Shops are so crowded and it takes a long time to find what we want and what we need. Also we got to face a long queue in order to pay. Spending long hours shopping it is tiring for some people. I find it very tiring sometimes.###I often shop with no problems, but on Saturday it is not the same. The shops are so crowded and it takes a long time to find what we want and what we need.

Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money. Usually much more money we spend than we expect. We can't do anything about is. We have to face it - it has both sides.

According to your letter, I can choose two activities to do at the Camp. I would like to choose painting, which I have been doing for 12 years, and tennis.

'Cry Freedom' is about the blacks and whites of South Africa. The main characters of this book are Stephen Biko, a black leader, and Donald Woods who is a white newspaper editor.

The main characters of this book are Stephen Biko, a black leader, and Donald Woods who is a white newspaper editor. Woods is thought to stand for all of white people and this book could have an influence on them.
In the first part of this book it can be seen that Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude to them. In some ways, he did not agree with "Black Consciousness" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites. Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live. The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him. Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist, in other words, he became an activist for the black people of South Africa.###In the first part of this book it can be seen that Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude towards them.

Dear Ms. Ryan, I am writing to you, in reply for your letter. Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is summer season, and it is nice weather to enjoy in California.

In regard to the activities, I would like tennis, because I have some experience playing, and my spin and volley are very good, and painting, because I have learnt some techniques, that I would like to put on practise. Lastly, I would like to know if I need to bring any special clothes, and where can I change my money to American dollars cheaper. I would like ask for your prompt reply, so I can start organizing myself. Thanking you, Yours sincerely, Carmen Dolores Rossell###Dear Ms. Ryan, I am writing to you, in reply to your letter.

Firstly, you need to know, and be counscious of what you are doing. I spend two weeks preparing all the stage, speakers, background, michrophones, everything, with all the staff, and every night, the artists came to rehearsal their show, I could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff. The day of the concert, everyone, including the artists and managers were nervous and were tired, however, when the concert started, we saw that all our efforts were worthy, the crow and artists thanked the staff.###Firstly, you need to knowconscious what you are doing.

What I personally liked the most was all our teamwork. I could see the staff, managers, artists and even the director, all like a big team, working together. That was what made it mostly special.

I would prefer to stay in log cabins because the weather is going to be rainy, according to the forecast. Therefore, I have chosen golf and tennis from the list. I have been playing them for more than 3 years, in which I have been trained, 3 years for tennis, 1 year for golf, by the professional coaches. I'm enjoy playing both of them regularly.###I would prefer to stay in log cabins because the weather is going to be rainy, according to the forecast.

In my opinion shopping could be a 'dangerous' activity because you may spend more money in some clothes that you can afford. I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping.

About accommodation, I would prefer the log cabins because I think they are more cleaner than the tents.

Another point is to go to a big area. Specially at week-ends. Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around. People should have to take a license to drive those things. Someone could be injured. And of course, the time to pay. A huge que that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out.

First of all, I would like to travel in July because I can apply my holiday only in July. I have discussed it with my boss but he allowed me to go on a holiday only in July. And about accommodation, I would like to stay in a tent. I know that staying in a log cabin is more convinient but I just want to feel a wilder experience. While I am at the camp, I would like to enjoy swimming and photography. It will be a wonderful experience to swim in a lake and I can relax and enjoy the fresh air. Photography is one of my hobbies so I want to take nice photos in the camp area as many as I can.###First of all, I would like to travel in July because I can take in July.

I hate shopping but in the other hand sometimes you can have fun at it. In my opinion, it dependes on your mood, your financial ability, off course, where you are going to do shopping and what you are going to buy.###I hate shopping but on the other hand sometimes you can have fun doing it.

Usualy people don't have time for shopping. You've just finished your long hours at work, you are tide, you had a row with your boss but you are still going to do shopping. And what do you have. There are huge queus to the tills, noise, hussle, poor custumer service. You've got more stress, you feel fed up and finaly when you got home you think that shopping is not that enjoyable as you thought.###Usually people don't have time for shopping.

For example, a lot of people do not like to do shopping in big stores. It takes hours to buy something. There are so many varaity of products, different prices, different quality. You should walk miles around the store to find what you wanted. Yes, there is a big plus for a big store of course. You can find everything in one place, instead of small shops which is specialised on one product. And people spend all weekends walking around shopping cities and high streets in trills to buy something.###For example, a lot of people do not like to go shopping in big stores.

"Shopping is not always enjoyable" "Shopping today!" If You decide to go in town or during holidays to move in a "shopping destination", that is mean that you need something special for you or someone else. You have the money and the time as you want. That's why it should be a great day! Save some money to go for shopping in Paris or Roma and see how is the French or Italian fashion looks on yourself! and after that you can make a stop in the Duty-free shops and buy some chipper souvenirs. Singapoor and many places in Asia are famous for the shopping, and it is really nice to go there with enough money to buy that you always wanted to. But even if shopping can means dream it can be boring sometimes. If you have no money and a friend ask you to come for shopping, it should be boring! and you may become jealous against him and want him to do that quickly! or you may are going to get nervous! And you can find that there are too much people in the shops, it is too hot or you can not have your right size or the right colour or flavour -- - then you get angry! or you decide to not spend the money in shopping today, but in front of the shop. What is going on??###"Shopping is not always enjoyable" "Shopping today!"

It was a marvellous concert and there were about 100,000 people there. I worked as a receptionist in the Vip room and I needed to look very happy during all the time, what wasn't very difficult. You will can't believe how many famous people I known. I met Madonna and could talk with her for ten minutes. It was a dream and she was amazing with me.###It was a marvellous concert and there were about 100,000 people there.

We was so close to him, I didn't have the chance to talk with him but I don't mind, I will never forget that day.

You could go shopping for some rest to the high street or a department store. Then you could find the cheapest good and in that case, you probably buy it needlessly. Moreover if you bought something then you could find it is a little bit more expensive than the other shop.

A veteran fisher takes his boat and goes fishing to convine himself and other mans that he is still able to do that. Then, Hemingway paints a marvellous description of fishing act and of the great fight between the fish and the old man. The 24-hour fight is described in a so peacful, faithful way that it callas a though about life and death. I recommand this book a lot as a way both to discover Hemingway and american litterature.###A veteran fisherman takes his boat and goes fishing to convince himself and other men that he is still able to do it.

There are people that loves going to the shopping. They live, work and only think about it. They are addicted in buying things. Some doctors say that buy without control is a disease and I agree with them because I have a friend who is a compulsory buyer. He can't stop buying things, he spend all his money buying things that he sometimes don't use. I think this is one bad side of shopping and many people have this problem.###There are people that love going to the shopping. They live, work and only think about it.

Then I visited another one, in Cambridge Street. It was very crowded, I could hardly walk in the shop. I decided to by a CD room driver for my old computer. When I approached to the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone. My money, travel card and credit card had gone. It was a nightmare, there were pickpokets in the shop. I went to the shop assistance but it was useless.###Then I visited another one, in Cambridge Street. It was very crowded, I could hardly move in the shop.

First of all because of the big variety in the store. Very often you don't know what to buy because we don't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from, not, we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike, adidas or Fila.###First of all because of the great variety in the store, very often you don't know what to buy because we don't have only three or four different sports shoes to choose from, no, we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike, Adidas or Fila.

Of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping isn't always great fun, but the last cause, which is very important for me, is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal. That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where noone has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me, no one to talk to and noone to complaine to. That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in little stores, where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complaine about.###Of course there are a lot of other reasons why shopping isn't always great fun, but the last reason, which is very important for me, is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal.

I mainly gave them a hand in setting up the stage. You know, although I'm a pop music fan, I'd never had any idea how it was prepared for opening. First, they asked me to put those instruments on the stage. I left the hi-fi system on the left side (it should be on the other side). Before his opening, the pop star found the mistake, otherwise it would be a disaster.###I mainly gave them a hand in setting up the stage.

The day of the show I worked so hard that I couldn't see the spectacle. And I didn't even got paid. But it was worthy. I found my reward when the concert finished. After been carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three hours, I was eshausted. But when Britney came out of the stage, she passed by me, saw my tired face and invited me to her personal changing room. We talked for about half an hour and when she said goodbye she gave me a kiss. I won't forget that moment ever. Write to me soon to tell me your impression about what happened to me.

Here are some of the information: I would like to travel in July because then the school year ends and I will be able to go on vacation. I would prefer to stay in log cabins because I can't sleep outside in a tent. I would be very pleased if I could practice basketball and swimming. I am very good at basketball and I am playing in my school's team. I know how to swim and dive from high places. I am very keen on both sports.###Here is some of the information: I would like to travel in July because the school year ends then and I will be able to go on vacation.

You know that last month I helped at a pop concert and I've enjoyed it very much. I did many different kinds of things. First of all I helped with the decoration of the place where the consert would take place. Then I helped the dancers with their dance on stage. After that I helped the singers perform and dance together and finally I helped with the lights for the show. It was amazing!

I had a really great time working with all the pop singers and dancers and decorators. I even met some very interesting people with who I made really good friends. What I liked the most was working with the singers, teaching them how to dance and follow some footsteps.###I had a really great time working with all the pop singers and dancers and decorators.

First, I would like to travel during July. Because my college will finish in the end of June and I am going to go back to Japan in August. Second, I prefer to stay in a log cabin. I usually stay in a tent during camping. Actually, I don't like tent so much. Therefore, I am interested in staying in a log cabin. Third, I chose painting and golf as activities. I learned painting when I was a school student. Specially, I like water painting. Also, I belonged to a golf club when I went to university in Japan.###First, I would like to travel during July.

I am very proud of myself because of the way I managed the whole experience, although there were moments when I thought I wasn't going to be able to cope with all the pressure. Especially when the musicians arrived, they can be very demanding people and sometimes they came up with very odd requests. For example once they wanted mineral water of a certain French label, which was impossible to get.###I am very proud of myself because of the way I managed the whole experience, although there were moments when I thought I wasn't going to be able to cope with all the pressure, especially when the musicians arrived.

My tasks were very especifics. I had to help with the layout of the stage, which was very complicated, because there are so many cables, and weir and things going on at the same time. After that part was fully-functioning I moved on to work in the back stage.###My tasks were very specific.

I really enjoyed working with those people, they are all very professional although they may look a bit eccentric sometimes.

In order to celebrate the 125 aniversary of the city, the Coun Council organised an open air concert. It was a summer night and all the citizens, as well as tourists, had the opportunity to attend. The pop band "Five" arrived into town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also with building the stages and  sound. I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager. I couldn't believe it when he said: "O.K., if you want to help, here is a list of what you can do." My job was to leave some leaflets on shops, restaurants and on the streets.###In order to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the city, the County Council organised an open air concert.

I would like to go to the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students. Other reason is, I think in July the weather is not so cold. The weather condition will be suitable for camping. I prefer to live in tents to log cabin because sleeping in the tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to the nature. Every night I would like to come out of the small tent to the nice enviroment outside the tent. Although, living in the tent is more comfortable. I'll have to be aware about insects so I've bought so many insects repellant. I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and go swimming. When I was in the fourth form, I got the first prize in a swimming competition and third prize in tennis. I was a bit disapotted with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or secound price.###I would like to go on the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students.

Hi! How are you. I am fine and I hope you're fine too. I have an interesting story to tell you. I've been asked to help by the well known band called Westlife. At first I was surprised but in a few secound later, when I relised that, I didn't allow to go, I tried to persuade my teacher to let me go. At last, she allowed me to go.###Hi! How are you?

I had to help them behind the state, while they were get dressed. I had to keep things in place and cheakd that the microphones was working properly. Although the work was not heavey, I gained a lot of experience. They gave me their signature and when the concert started, they told me to come up on the state and dance with them. I was really embarassed because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that is the very good experience I have ever had. I was really enjoy at the concert. Thing that I particularly like in the concert is I got a free ticket from Westlife to go to the A1 concert, which is another well known band. I really want to have that experience again.###I had to help them behind the stage, while they were getting dressed.

Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins, I think I prefer both of them, because I've never been there before, and never heard of these two places. I am very interested in both places but, I can just choose one place, I think I will choose log cabins, it's sounds good and if I have time, maybe I can go to tents next time (maybe next year.)###Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins.

When I am at Camp, I will choose singing and photography. I can sing classic music and pop music, seem like rock & roll. Maybe TITANIC. My mum liked me singing this song. And I can also make very good photography, because I learned to do this in China two years ago.###When I am at Camp, I will choose singing and photography.

They were giving two concerts, one in Friday and the other one in Saturday they invited me to go on friday. This is what happened: when I arrive they told me that I was helping in backstage with the scenery, then the group arrived, we chat for like 15 minutes, then they had to go on stage. Here is where the good part starts, I was doing the courtines (opening and closing) when Nick came up to me and ask me to go on stage with him, my heart started beating very hard. The next second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing with The Backstreet Boys. I had a great time that day.###They were giving two concerts, one on Friday and the other one on Saturday. They invited me to go on Friday.

Many classes and activities are important in our school. But I have to make a choice in order to select from among them. The class of mecanics seem to be the more important lesson. It use a lot of technics that we learn in other classes. It gives us the knowledge  usefull for many school club, like the "marathon shell" club or the robotich club. Besides it gives all the areas covered by a mecanic ingenier and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mecanic ingenier. It lets us specify our abilities in the part of mecanics that we prefer. But there are other lessons very important (like English of course!) Actually, I have a regret, there is no ethic lessons, It would show us how use our knowledge.###Many classes and activities are important in our school.

If possible, the type of accomodation I prefer is in tent. there are two main reasons for the choice: I am very keen on camping in high mountains and hills and I am very skilled in all the relative activities: building-up the tent, cooking on camp and so on. Furthermore I have several personal objects that play a fundamental role in the camp daily life (the tent, the sleep bag and so on.). Among the proposed activities, I prefer swimming and singing. Indeed, I like the water sport and I am a quite good guitar and singer - Some questions: What about the average temperature at the camp on July? What are the better clothes to use at the camp?

On the other hand, when the shops are crowded (for instance, just before Christmas), going shopping can be very stressful, as you cannot walk freely and have to bear endless queues.

It was very exciting because she could play at the same time two people: herself and the houskeeper. Although from my point of view she planned the murder of his uncle and was able to do it. I think that her husband only followed what she ordered him. She was the head in this story. The plan was almost perfectly and the police hadn't discovered the murderer without the help of Mr. Poirot.###It was very exciting because she could play two people at the same time: herself and the housekeeper.

In my opinion Mrs. Havering was a extremely intelligent person in addition to being a very good actress and this made this story full of suspense.

For example, any shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends. Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins. What's worse, there is usually a traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall. And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare. So I prefer shopping at weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment.###For example, all shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends.

Firstly, I was asked the time my trip would be and I have come to a conclusion that the only time I will be able to go is in July because during this very month I have my winter break both from work and school and that is when I will be free to go.###Firstly, I was asked when my trip would be and I have come to the conclusion that the only time I will be able to go is in July because during that very month I have my winter break both from work and school and that is when I will be free to go.

Another point mentioned was the choice of activities. I would like to try sailing as I have never sailed before and also climbing as I enjoy hiking a lot.

Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes, however, do we really like the process of chosing them?

What is more, we can say that price is often very off-putting as well. Most people usually go shopping for something which is affordable, and many times they find, for example, a dress, they like a lot but they cannot buy it because it is terribly expensive. Then, I consider it a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress.###What is more, we can say that price is often very off-putting as well.

You offered me a really wide range of activities to choose from, but I would have to go for basketball and tennis.

First of all, I don't like and don't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley (which, by the way, has it's own idea of where it want's to go) between other desperate people baskets, just to find that perfect tin of beans or a toothpaste. Especially that it is so hard to find anything in a modern, huge and stuffed with lots of merchandise department stores. Secondly, if you happen to forget something, you will have to force your way back through crowds of other shoppers, and that can take up even more time. But the worst thing comes at the end. Your visit to the shop conludes in a long queue to the checkout (where you can easily spend another 30 minutes) where they will suck out some money from your account. Where's the fun in that?###First of all, I don't like and don't enjoy spending endless hours pushing my trolley (which, by the way, has its own idea of where it wants to go) between other desperate people's baskets, just to find that perfect tin of beans or some toothpaste.

Given the circumstances, they asked my for helping in the kitchen. You can imagine how disappointed I was. But it turned out as a funny and interesting job. I had to prepare the ingredians for every meal. It means I had to read the recipies very carefully. And I had to controll that nothing will be missed. The best thing was that I learnd a lot of new cooking ideas and I could observe new cooking tricks. On the other hand I had a lot to do and I was never bored.

The concert started on the 15th of may and it was a real great session in our valley. I was so happy when they told me to help them with the organisation.

I've learned a lot about management and especially - how stars are living.###The concert started on the 15th of May and it was a really great session in our valley.

About the travel, I think it would be preferable to do it on July, which is a holiday periode and so I won't have any special obligations. While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent, so I can live closer to the nature. Anyway the accommodation is not a big problem for me, because I will be away most of the time. Stay a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worse thing to do, specialy during a trip! Moreover I would like it if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball. Any little tournaments of this kind would be greateful.###About the trip, I think it would be preferable to do it in July, which is a holiday period and so I won't have any special obligations.

But as the correct started and we finished what we had to do, we were free to do what ever we wanted. So the party started... The pop concert was exellent and I had a lot of fun.

It was really an unforgettable experience.###From the first moment that I got there I understood that I was going to have a great night.

I am not really keen on art that is why I would prefer doing some sports like surfing and sailing. If I have to be honest, I would say I have never practised none of them.

I went with a group of friends to help and organise a gig of a pop band. It was so easy, a mean we just carried all the instruments from the musicians to the Club and we put it on the stage. After this, we helped to the service bar, to put into the fridges all the drinks and refreshments. And that was it! I enjoyed a lot doing this and at least the gig was free for all of us. The concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out. Marevellous!###I went with a group of friends to help and organise a gig of a pop band.

Well this is abosolutly true, espacially when you go shopping on Saturday. Everyone goes shopping on Saturday so the mall is always crowed, and most of the people are stressed, it's crazy. For exemple, you go into a cloth shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that would fit their new skirt, so they are looking every where, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want. And then they have it and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you choose. And you have to wait after that to buy it, so finally you waited so long that you are getting late, so you get stressed to. So it's really not enjoyable to go shopping. Plus, most of the time, you see all those mothers looking after their kids, and yelling their name's kids into the shopping mall because they lost them. So you are getting a headache because you hear the kids crying, the mothers yelling, if I can give you an advice: DON'T GO SHOPPING ON SATURDAY!! You get headaches, you get stressed, and finally you get bruses because of the woman that pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you!!!###Well this is absolutely true, especially when you go shopping on Saturday.

Really? Sometimes things can be wrong and the situations changes and becomes a nightmare.

Then the search for a nice cloth starts, and when eventually you get it, it isn't your size, but also the colour that you like is not available.

I would like to travel in July this year because I think the weather will be nice and I can take a holiday. I would like to use a tent for my accommodation.

I choose swimming and painting for my activities while I am at the Camp. I really like swimming. When I was a child, I used to go swimming with my family at the weekend, having a chat, making a barbecue, playing games. It was such a good time. I enjoy painting as well. My mother told me that I'm good at painting. When I was in high school, I won second prize in a painting competition. My parents were very pround of me.###I choose swimming and painting for my activities while I am at the Camp. I really like swimming.

I've got some great news to tell you. Last month, I worked as a part-time job. I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert. As you know, I'm crazy about pop music. Before the concert I was really exciting. I couldn't sleep well and I didn't know what I had to do in the concert.###I've got some great news to tell you. Last month, I got a part-time job.

It was such a big concert. There were lots of singers and a band. Of course, there were lots of spectaculars. First, I was in front of the entrance door. I had to check tickets. I was really exciting. My hands were sclumbling but I did it very well. After that, I went to the back stage. I could see lots of pop stars. I'm sorry that I didn't ask them to take any pictures for you. I was really busy. I had to take care of them and did everything they want. For instance, taking them to the toilet, making coffee for them, helping them find their stuff. It was really busy but I really enjoyed it.###It was such a big concert.

As a teenager I must addmit that there is nothing more enjoyable from shopping. It's like ,,walking in the clouds,, you feel like you are flaing.

It's hard for me even to emagine the situation when shopping is not enjoyable. Probably it is one of the moments when you want something baddly and you can't have it.

It is very pleasant when you are looking for something special or for special occasions like wedding, birthday, or Christmas presents. Next, it can be very good for your wallet to save some money, when you will find a bargain or sales. As well as that, some shop-assistance can give you a lower price, because you always do shopping at their shop. What is more, most people cannot live without shopping. It is their way to spend free time.###When describing the advantages, we should remember that most people like doing shopping.

On the other hand, there are some minuses. On top of that, shopping is very tiring and exhausting. Walking from shop to shop carrying heavy bags, takes much of your time. Instead of that you could do more interesting things. such as playing sports or reading a book. Besides that, shopping steal you from money. Very often people go to a shop - usually a big departament store and buy things which they do not need.###On the other hand, there are some minuses. Above all, shopping is very tiring and exhausting.

In my opinion shopping is very tiring and I usually try to avoid doing it. When I have to, I do it, but I think we waste too much time on it that we should. On balance some people still like shopping even if it is not always enjoyable and they have to stand in a long queue to buy something. From my point of view it depands on us if shopping will be enjoyable or not.###In my opinion shopping is very tiring and I usually try to avoid doing it.

As you asked, I think I'd like to travel only in July, because I am quite busy with my job. July is the only free time that I have.

It is very kind for you to give me the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp. I'd like to have climbing and sailing. Actually I am quite good at climbing. I often go climbing in my town.

For me, I don't think shopping is enjoyable at all. I even hate shopping. I only go to shop unless I really need something.

As you have informed me, there are a lot of activities that we can do. The swimming is my best sport. I was born and raised on a Greek island called Crete. The sea is part of myself.

I am of the opinion that the morning English lessons with our teacher, George, are worth filming and showing for many reasons. Above all, they are enjoyable and interesting. All of us participate effectively. Nobody is yawning or feeling bored. I want this opinion won't imply that the other lessons of other teachers aren't interesting. I think we are lucky with our competent teachers. Besides the practical lessons of the cooking course level NVQ3 might be interesting with the delicious dishes of meat and vegetables. The pictures will be amazing and wonderful.###I am of the opinion that the morning English lessons with our teacher, George, are worth filming and showing for many reasons.

"Wuthering Heights" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very truly afimation in the case of my book because the main character of the story is a very wicked man. Besides that, this character is more interesting than the others due to his complex mind and his deep, evil manners. It's the richest character at all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason of whatever happens to the others characters. They are always suffering from the revenge that Heathcliff is swear, the cause of which is the miserable situation the other character have put him in. From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated by his bad temper. He's not good not because he was born with this trend to harm but because the others character make him become thus. This revenge links the story together so without it we would not have such "Wuthering Heights". I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important point of every book, film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them.###"Wuthering Heights" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very true affirmation in the case of my book because the main character in the story is a very wicked man.

Our job was to prepare the scene. We've built it using ready metal and wodden parts. It was really big and impressive.

People are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get tied. People are not smiling to each other, not talking to each other at the shops.

In my opinion shopping is just something to cover our basic needs. Shops are lifes. Try to give up shopping one day and try to spend your day with friends, going to play something together. It feels much more better. You'll have happy memories and be in a good mood.###In my opinion shopping is just something to cover our basic needs. Shops are lives.

The most difficult work was to arrange the coach trip to the concert hall as there were many audience from the countryside. It was too complicated. But the rest of the preparation was so good. I've realised pop stars are just like us, down to earth. They were so kind and modest. Do you know what I liked most from this experience? I've found pop music so wonderful, it changed my idea of that classic music is always best. Of course, I've enjoyed being around famous singers, too.###The most difficult work was to arrange the coach trip to the concert hall as there were many people from the countryside.

But, when during any peak season, like Christmas, holidays or even during weekends. Then I can say I'm definatly doesn't feel any enjoyable. Because of the crowd. For me I think, it is not shopping that is kind of suffering. Especially, queue up for twenty minutes for just paying the money or waiting for the salesgirl getting your the right size of clothes. So sometimes I don't think shopping is enjoyable, and if there is any big festival, I would rather stay at home and watch television.###But, when during any peak season, like Christmas, holidays or even during weekends, then I can say I definitely don't feel it is enjoyable, because of the crowds.

When it comes to activities, I would like to try climbing and surfing. I started surfing when I was 12. So I am quite confident with this. Although I had a few experiences of climbing, my everyday training at gym would retrieve my concerning. In addition to these reasons, both activities are popular, especially in California.###When it comes to activities, I would like to try climbing and surfing. I started surfing when I was 12.

'As I have a choise I would prefer to stay in log cabins to tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so depended on weather conditions. As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list. So I decided to choose climbing and photography. These two are easy to connect, I could climb and make pictures at the same time. I am very keen on photography. Last year I took part in a photograher's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in the cathegory of ,,beautiful scenery''. Climbing, in contrast, is something I started a few months ago, so I have not gained any success in this sport. But you could give me a chance to get more familier with it. I would like to ask about clothes. Do I need any formal ones?

There is a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping. You might spend too much money and buy something you don't really need. You could also buy something which later turns out to be out of order. So you have to complain about it. Very often a shop assistant is not helpful so you lose your money and your time.###There are a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping.

Firstly, I would like to inform you that I prefer travelling in July to travelling in another month. The reason for it, is that, July is the only month in which, I am on holidays so I will not have to miss any classes. Next, I would prefer stay in a tents rather than stay in a log cabins because I appreciate having straight contact with nature. Therefore, I have chosen climbing and swimming as the two activities on which I am good at. I can say I am good at swimming, because in the club I used to be the first in all the competitions and as for climbing I used to climb trees, walls, everything in my childhood without falling.###Firstly, I would like to inform you that I prefer travelling in July to travelling in any other month.

Wonderful, Breathtaking, Fabulous, these are some adjectives to describe just a little bit how my experience was. Starting with good points, I could say that you can talk face to face with the pop stars. Moreover, you have the unique opportunity to take your pictures taken with them, to have their names written, on your notebook by themselves. Despite of being tiring, it was rewarding because I noticed that all the singers are ordinary people who want to see their fans happy and satisfied and that is true I experienced that. Another thing is that they pay you for you job and it is a good money. Don't worry because you don't pay for your ticket, it is "free". From my point of view, there were not disadvantages.###Wonderful, Breathtaking, Fabulous, these are some adjectives to describe just a little bit how my experience was.

First, I would like to travel in July because it is the only free month I have in the summer. I have exams in June and a work in August. Then, about accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I am used to it. I have already been in different summer camps and I always choose this accommodation, I find it more friendly than a log cabin.###First, I would like to travel in July because it is the only free month I have in the summer.

The activities that I'd like to do: First one it would be basketball and to be honest I can play it very well due to I used to be a basketball player in my high school.

Sometime when you ask your friend, especially girls. What would you like to do after the class or during the weekend?" The typical answer would be 'I'm going to the shop because I like it, even windows shopping would be fine'. However, for me shopping is not always enjoyable. Why? First of all, it's wasting my time, especially when I can't find the thing I want, this is very frustrating. In addition, it's so tiring to walk around the place over and over to find the thing you want. Apart from that, it's quite annoying when you have to compare or to survey the price in order to buy the cheapest one, if possible. Once you've got all on your shopping list, you also have to carry all the bags that you just bought, which is very heavy sometime.###Sometimes when you ask your friend, especially girls, "What would you like to do after the class or during the weekend?" the typical answer would be 'I'm going to the shop because I like it, even window shopping would be fine'.

 Shopping, for most the people it is very important because you need to get the stuff you need or you want. For some people it may be a method to relax themselves, after you have been to work or school. So it is a thing you will enjoy most of the time, but still have something you will not enjoy it. It depends on what is the place and the aim you are shopping. For example, some people always shopping to get food or stuff the need in everyday life, they won't enjoy this kind of shopping, because it is not getting what they want. The place where you are shopping is also very important. For example, in HK all the areas have lots of people it won't let you feel good of the noise and times when you are shopping. Because have too many people it make you want to stay home and you won't enjoy shopping.### Shopping is very important for most people because you need to get the stuff you need or you want.

They go together in groups, then they prepare power point presentations and at least they present it in front of the other pupils and teachers.###Next I would film a BWPM lesson.

I think then we should film an informatic-lesson. It would be funny to present the computers, which are often overcharged, or often the netserver is spinning. It's really funny to see the helpless teacher, who wants to go on writing in excel or a word text, while the computers do not work or brake down.###I think then we should film an information-technology lesson.

First of all, I am a student and would like to travel in July. Because I intend to take an examination in Septenber. So I can afford to go on holiday only in July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay at log cabins rather than tents. It will be my first time to experience to stay there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried.###First of all, I am a student and would like to travel in July.

The next consideration is the activities. Actually, I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident of it. And nowadays, I have been practicing tennis as a school activity.

You can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert, apart from the musicists and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security service... it was so exciting! My work consisted in checking the tickets,  the number on them and taking the people to their seats.###You can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert.

When I was a child I never like to go shopping because my Mum spend so much time on the shops that I remember that going shopping with her, was a nigthmare. It is ameaising how people change during the years, for example now shopping for me is one of the most entertaining things, and every week I have to buy something. I enjoy so much fashion that my life change completely since I start to study clothes designer and I discover that fabrics, and colors, are really enjoyable. But in this days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer  and you pay the full price, on the end of the season it is half price, I find it very anfair for people who pay a lot of money on their clothes. Anyway, shopping is allways a satisfation for rich people, because they can afforded it and they don't main to spend the full price on their clothes.###When I was a child I never liked to go shopping because my Mum spent so much time in the shops that I remember that going shopping with her, was a nightmare.

In my opinion the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind of things for her family, so, for them, shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drive them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money.###In my opinion the majority of the people who go shopping are women who must buy food and other kinds of things for their families, so, for them, shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated every day and that drives them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money.
Othrewise, there are people who think the opposite; such as: children, teenagers, men; but not always, because they go to buy hardly ever, only when they need clothes, or something for their job or school.

I think that when you want to buy something you have to be sure of what you really need, if not the shop assistant has the ability to persuade you to buy something you do not want. Moreover in the shops that sales fashionable clothes. Although it is wonderful to buy new things, there are times that it really become tiring.###I think that when you want to buy something you have to be sure of what you really need, if not the shop assistant has the ability to persuade you to buy something you do not want.

When I was at the Univercity I was very keen on basket ball and I was playing in the Univercity's team. In 1998 we were the champion of the First National Leque. Also I am a quite good swimmer.

You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping at last month? I must say that was a great fun, I've never had this kind of experience before. Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets, they are list of pop band and group which will appear in the concert in order, and some information about their performance and backgrounds. After that, I had to help people who had a ticket but can't find their seat. During the concert, I didn't have a lot to do, so I had a chance to see most of the performance, that was excellent. I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars. During the break time I did give a lots of direction to people who can't find the toilet, and gave people information such as where they could have a cup of coffee. That was a bit boring, but it was part of my job.###You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping at last month? I must say that was a great fun.

Dear Helen Ryan. I'm so glad to hear I have won first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Thank you for asking me for some details. I'd like to travel in July. Because I am a university student, I have got classes until the midle of June and I have to attend to a 'Development & Research Conference' at the end of June. Otherwise I have to work at a business department office as a assistant from the beginning of Aguest. So I will be able to travel in July. Accommodation is very important for me as well. I would prefer staying in log cabins. I've got some skin trouble and I can't sleep very well in tents. I have ever slept in tents when I went camping. That time I had to sleep in a tent. Whole night, I felt backache ands shoulder ache so I couldn't sleep very well. And I've never stayed in log cabins. It sounds wonderful! Could I have the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp? I'd very much like to do painting and swimming. I am quite good at painting. Especially I love water-painting. I really want to paint the countryside of California. It will be a fantastic experience for me. Actually I can't swimming at all. I'm afraid of water. That is why I couldn't have swimmed yet. I think this chance is a very good for me to learn to swim. I expect to join the above two activities. I want to know how much money I need. You pay for all costs. But I think I'll need some money for clubing or evening events. And please let me know How the weather is. I'll buy some clothes, shoes and a hat. So I must know if it is cold or hot. I'm looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible Your sincerely###Dear Helen Ryan, I'm so glad to hear I have won first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.

I think this a for me to learn to swim. I expect to join the above two activities. I want to know how much money I need. You pay for all costs. But I think I'll need some money for clubbing or evening events. And please let me know How the weather is. I'm going to buy some clothes, shoes and a hat. So I must know if it is cold or hot. I'm looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible Yours sincerely
But when I stand at every shops, I can't stand my desire. If I have got enough money to buy something what I want to buy, I can buy them and it will be no problem. However, If I haven't got enough money, I will not be able to buy what I want and it will be a very big problem. I feel depressed. Shopping is not enjoyable any more. I'll think about why I'm so poor. But I can get over it. I go window shopping. Insead of buying something, I buy some fresh food and Ice-cream. They make me happy and rich. I can try every the shoes, clothes, hats, accessories and jakect on. They are mine!###But when I stand outside every shop, I can't resist my desire.

First, I was wondering if I could travel in July. I am working at a language school. Due to a shortage of teachers in summer I can take holiday only in July. Second, I would like to sleep in a tent because I have never slept in a tent and I have wanted to sleep there. Third, I have chosen 'Tennis' and 'Photography' for my activities at the Camp. I have been playing tennis for over ten years. In addition, I have been teaching children to play tennis for three years. I took up taking photos four years ago. Since then I have entered ten competitions and won the first prize three times.###First, I was wondering if I could travel in July. I am working at a language school.

First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived. The music instruments were transported from the lorries (three big lorries!) into the concert hall and I helped to put them at the right position on the stage. They were very heavy and I had to carry them with care because they were very important for the band. After that I helped to test lights and microphones. I almost fainted when the band arrived and entered the stage. I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in the flesh.###First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived.

The most exciting thing about my experience was that the band spoke to me after the concert. The band was very satisfied with the stage and appreciated our work.

I prefer staying in tents because it is an unusual experience for me. Also I'd like to have the chance to play tennis and try sailing at the camp. Talking about tennis, I used to play it for about five years when I was a child. I think I'm much better than a beginner. But I never had a chance to enjoy sailing.

Now, I have two questions about camping. First, what clothes should I bring? Is it hot enough? I've never been to California, therefore please let me know about the weather there. Second, how much money to I need? I haven't a clue about it. I'd like to know some examples.###Now, I have two questions about camping. First, what clothes should I bring? Is it hot enough?

As I mentioned before, I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month, the artist's name was "Bonny Pink", who is famous in my country. I could enjoy her music very much.###As I mentioned before, I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. The artist's name was "Bonny Pink", who is famous in my country.

My job was looking after her when she had a break time. I guided her to a rest room and served her a cup of tea, and so on. I thought it was a most exciting job. Actually, I could have a chance to ask her about music, her favorite artist and her hobby. I was impressed when I heard that she liked playing puzzle alone. She seemed to be a very active woman when she was singing but at the same time she had a very gentle attitude when she spoke to me. I became a fan of her.###My job was looking after her when she had a break time. I guided her to a rest room and served her a cup of tea, and so on. I thought it was a most exciting job.

The activities are really interesting and I would take part on Painting and Climbing. I am not very good at painting, but I like it because it is a good oportunity to practice it.

I choose these activities because I love challenges.###The activities are really interesting and I would take part in Painting and Climbing.

In your letter you ask me to choose beetween tents or log cabins, well I prefer to stay in a log cabin. It is more confortable and I am afraid about wild animals. I saw, you offer a lot of activities, that'is fantastic! It is very difficult to decide which two of these activities I like most and I can also do the best. I think I choose singing because I have sung for five years in a church chorus and I do it very well. The other activity I like very muche is swimming.

In the afternoon the singers cames in and I also could have an interview with Ricky Martin. I was very excited! He is very beatiful! At the end of the interview he invites me to have dinner with him after the concert. I logically accepted. The interview I liked particularly. Before the concert started, we had to  verify all the music instruments. The microphones all had to be controlled. Fortunatly we had no problem. The concert was a success. I was very proude of me and the work I had done. After the concert I left with Ricky Martin.

We had always enjoying ourselves. Never had I got such a great time. From your's list of activities I choose sailing and climbing. I'm keen on sailing, it is my favourite sport. I find it very atractive. I have been sailing since my father had bought a boat in 1980, when I was only five years old. However, I have never taken part in any competitions connected with this sport. For me it is only a hobby. Last year I took up climbing and I want to carry on learning this sport.###We had always enjoyed ourselves. Never had I had such a great time.

I used to like shopping, but recently I came across many disadvantage of this activity. Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything what they want. It isn't true. Nowdays we have many big shopping centers. We like them because everything is on one place. The most suitable time for shopping is the weekand when parents don't work and children haven't got a school. Because of that, shopping centers are over crowded. You can't buy something in a peacful and calm athmospher. In addition, in such kind of shops prizes are very high, of course not all of them. However such centers are very useful and necessary. I my opinion the worst thing which may happened is an extremly hugh queu to the changing room. It is really exhausting. Afterwards you are all in. Nevertheless sometimes shopping could be enjoyable. If you bought something goregous, you would be very happy. On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you have a bad mood don't go shopping.###I used to like shopping, but recently I came across many disadvantages of this activity.

Last month, I helped out at a pop concert, which I really enjoyed. The singer, who took place, wasn't one of my favourites, but having the opportunity to experience being a stuff there, was just amazing. I was just behind the stage. I was supposed to help my friend with the lights, so that I could see all that screaming like made crowd. I even saw crying girls, who were trying to reach the pop-singer.###Last month, I helped out at a pop concert, which I really enjoyed.

Do you know what Kim, I've never thought before, that enjoying yourself like this, could be weirdly . I think you never realize this, until you're not a part of the crowd. But I'm really happy, that I had even a small role in making people enjoying themselves. I mean, all that flashing lights, with the changing colours of them, I believe they helped much. Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colours was, I consider myself being very successful.###Do you know what Kim, I've never thought before, that enjoying yourself like this, could be weirdly .

And finally, the greatest news. I was introduced to the singer by my friend, who works for him. This was maybe the best part of being there.

I suppose, I will never forget that night.###And finally, the greatest news: I was introduced to the singer by my friend, who works for him. This was maybe the best part of being there.

First of all, I want to tell you what happened last month. Do you remember which is my favourite group? So, You don't believe me, but I enjoed helping at a Oasis's pop concert. I was a great and wonderful experience. The group needs to found a good microphone for the concert, because the singer lost his microphone last concert.

Of course you know, I'm a singer, so I came back quigky to my home, I picked up my microphone, and I handed it to the singer.###First of all, I want to tell you what happened last month.

I would like to make this trip the first week or the last week of July. Because my school finishes at the end of June and I will have a month break and after that. I have to do a computing course which I have already applied for it. Could you possibly tell me, at Camp California will I stay in tents or log cabins. Personily I prefer to stay in log cabins because they are much more comfortable than tents.###I would like to make this trip the first week or the last week of July because my school finishes at the end of June and I will have a month's break and after that.

I really enjoy swimming and playing tennis. Unfortunetley I am not good at both of them.

I am very excited and looking forward to the new experiance I am going to have. First of all I must tell you that I only have freetime in July -  at any day, any week, because I am still having my lesson at college and it will be finished at the end of June, and also in August I have a training course for my studies. I would prefer to stay in tents because I love the atmosephere of camping, but I wouldn't mind to stay in log cabins. For the two activities I can choose, I would like to have swimming and Basketball. I have always found these kind of activity make me fell strong and I enjoy doing it. I first started playing basketball and swimming when I was aged 9, and I have been doing it up till now. I also used to be in a basketball team in school for 3 years.###I am very excited and looking forward to the new experience I am going to have.

First of all I will be able to go to the U.S.A only in July because of my university. I am studying Economics and I am very busy nowadays. My exams will have finished at the end of June. I will only be able to set off in July and I also will give my thesis to my teacher in August. This holiday will help me to think about it and prepare it. I'd prefer staying in a log cabins because I need a proper place to say and study in. Basically, I don't like staying in a small tent. When I get to the camp, I'd like to swim and climb. I used to climb mountains and am good at climbing. I am fond of swimming but unfortunately I am not a good swimmer.###First of all I will be able to go to the U.S.A only in July because of my university.

I'd like to ask some questions  which I want to know. Is there any toilet and shower in the log cabins or somewhere nearby? Do I have to bring any special clothes?

Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert. It was unbelievable, and tiring as well. I saw all the pop bands and singers. I heard them talking behind the stage. They signed my diary and took a photo with me. Being a security guard was the hardest task. Carrying big speakers from place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laugh. Believe it or not, I put make up on one famous singer's face. I was just walking down by the dressing room and the manager said that if I could help them. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was in her room and helping her. Especially I liked that time. I advise you to do something like that. I'm going to help them again.###Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert.

First of all, I can only travel in July. I have a summer holiday from at the end of June to at the begging of September as I am a student, but I am planing to work in August as a part-time job. So that's the reason why I can not travel in August. I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabins, because I have had a camping once and I stayed in tents. It was great to have a fun and also memorise. As you said I will have the opportunity to do two activities. I am quite good at singing and I have a talent about singing that means I can entertain people by singing. In addition I am keen on swimming but actually I am not very good at swimming because I have just started to learn swimming but I have really been enjoying it and I think it will be a good chance to improve my swimming.###First of all, I can only travel in July.

There are, in contrast, disadvantages at the same time. When we are having a shopping, we often find that the place where people often go for a shopping is too crowed and it makes us more tired.

In addition, shop owner often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secreatly.

If you don't work and you have plenty of time going shopping is really enjoyable, because there are big shopping centres in which you can find so many different things. There are new products which you could not imagine that could be so interesting. Shopping is a good way to kill your time and some times you can not realize how fast the time goes. This happens because people enjoy themselves a lot.###If you don't work and you have plenty of time going shopping is really enjoyable, because there are big shopping centres in which you can find so many different things.

On the other hand there are some disadvantages. for example if you are a working mother with three children, that means you are always n a hurry, going shopping is really unenjoyable. You go shopping in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue.###On the other hand there are some disadvantages.

While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen, probably by a gypsie. I was so annoyed! I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny! My friends lent me some money, but it wasn't more than 120 pounds. I had to buy my dress, it's accesories and besides clothes and souvenirs! I couldn't really do much, so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs. I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop.###While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen, probably by a gypsy.

As you asked me some questions, here are the answers. It would be very convenient if I could travel in July, because by that time I'll be on my school holidays. If you agree I would like to have a tent as accommodation, because I have never stayed in one and I wonder this might be a great feeling and that this way I will be in a deeper contact with the animals that live in the area.###As you asked me some questions, here are the answers.

Shopping is not always enjoyable. Some people usually spend more money than they have and end up broken, with a lot of bills to pay. However, if you don't have those spending sprees very often, shopping can be a pleasant experience and a chance to spend some quality time with your family.###Shopping is not always enjoyable.

But don't be afraid.
Going to the shopping centre with you family can be a good experience. It's a moment in that you can talk to your relatives and use this conversation to know more about yourselves. If you are a good observer, it's a great chance to know what your son or daughter would like to have for her birthday or for any other special date.###Going to the shopping centre with your family can be a good experience.

In conclusion, if you go shopping reasonably, have a good time.

We all go shopping, maybe not every day, but certainly at least once a week. Shopping is very important because it's the only way to get things. For example, food. You will not be able to survive without food. So buying things neccessary is fine I think. But buying things that you do not need or you have not planned to might make you feel good at the time, but days or weeks later when you realise you did not need to spend money on them, you might regret buying them. For example you did not plan to buy any crisps, but they are at half price and you buy them without thinking. But after you never eat them and just bin them.###We all go shopping, maybe not every day, but certainly at least once a week. Shopping is very important because it's the only way to get things.

It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the leader of it fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark. The fans started shouting and wistling for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened. Then, a security guard started calling for help. I happened to be near him, so I went to help him. He asked me to help Bono, the leader, get up and to get him some water. I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him. There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger. Like an hour later, he recovered and the show began.###It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the singer fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights!

Well, on the whole, it was pretty cool. There was no big stress about it. The only thing I was asked to do was to help carry the lunches of the singers and to help with light and sound management, when the guy there had to do something else. Oh yes, I also had to check the tickets for five minutes. The woman had to deliver something. The problem about this job is that you have to deal with huge amounts of people.

But, as I said, the whole thing was fun. You must show a great sence of responsibility. But, Kim, can you see an other way to meet the "New Bentley" for free, talk to them and even get paid? That was my best day ever, the one when I shared a meal with Paul McPartney. I'm sure you are jalous now.

It's really great that you can suggest how to spend the rest of the time, because I enjoy swimming and it doesn't matter where - in the lake or swimming-pool. I think it's a very usefull and helpful thing for my health, especially when I do it with pleasure. The second of my favorit sport is tennis. I've played tennis for ten years.

Now I want to tell you about a pop concert as you have already knowen I helped my father to organize this concert. I was doing a lot of things like redecorating, drawing. Sometimes I gave some advices about suits and dresses. Often we looked repetitions and if something didn't like us we tried to correct it. The most enjoable thing was to smart people. We have a good and rich sponsor, that's why we could buy a lot of different materials with different colours and we tried to be polite with actors even if they didn't want to wear that part of cloth which we thought was more similar to their style. We always explained things to them and at the end they agreed with us. These days were so busy. But when we saw our show and heard how loud the audience claped them we were proud and understood that we spent a good time. You should try it and feel. I'll be waiting for your answer.###Now I want to tell you about a pop concert. As you known I helped my father to organize this concert. I was doing a lot of things like redecorating, drawing.

Please let me know how is the climate like at the Camp, so that I can take with me the right kind of clothes. It would be also useful for me to know if there will be some extra expenses, in order to take enough money for two weeks.###Please let me know what the climate is like at the camp, so that I can take with me the right kind of clothes.

However, there are a few moments in which you cannot enjoy shopping. The first one is the Christmas period. Shops are incredibly crowded. You cannot try on a dress and decide to buy it, or not in peace, because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn. In many cases, you do not even find the things you want, because the shops run out of products very quickly. Moreover, during this period, prices are usually much higher than in the other month's.###However, there are a few times in when you cannot enjoy shopping. The first one is the Christmas period.

Another situation in which shopping is not enjoyable, is when you go shopping with a man. For the majority of men, in fact, shopping is the most boring activity in the world. A man will try to prevent you from trying more than one dress on and will refuse to stay in the same shop for more than five minutes.###Another situation in which shopping is not enjoyable, is when you go shopping with a man.

As I see I have the chance to choose what accommodation I prefer.

It's incredible the large list of interesting activities that you offer. It's difficult just to try two but if I have the chance I would like to practice sailing and photography. I have never done noon of them before and as a result I can't be good at them but I've always wanted to sail because I love the sea and now I have the opportunitie. I also think that it would be great to learn about photography because it will give me the chance to go sightseeing and find wonderful places to take pictures.###The large list of interesting activities that you offer is incredible.

There is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself into the crowds, crambled in the small shops during the unique day-off you have to buy somthing you like. All this can easily leads to a nerve-collapse, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way across the crowds or while you were qeuing to pay. If this wasn't enough you strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when, despite having been stolen, having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry, you finally buy something you really liked with your credit card and, after having walked a few blocks, you see the same item at half the price in another shop.###There is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds, crammed in the small shops during the only day-off you have to buy something you like.

It's really difficult choose two activities from that list. Everyone are very interesting.

Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable. You can spend hours and hours going shopping and not find what you were looking for, perhaps because it is not in your size or the colour that you like, or just nothing is suitable to you. Another common problem could be the long queue in the fitting rooms, where you waiting stand up for your turn. After that, there is the unfriendly and sometime's unpolite shop assistance who breaks your nerves down. But never mind! the worst arrive when you get at home in the evening and find a chair to sit in because your feet are killing you and you realize you have spent all the money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight.###Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable.

I'm a woman and they say that shopping is women's best activity. But I have a particular problem. I'm not slim and I'm a little ashamed of my body. That's why shopping is not an easy thing to do.

When I go shopping I always have to ask for the extra-large size and it's harder to find it.###I'm a woman and they say that shopping is women's favourite activity. But I have a particular problem.

Secondly, could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin, because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents. Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing, because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool, so that I am good at swimming. However, I have never tried to go surfing. That is why I would like to do that.###Secondly, could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin, because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents.

It was very difficult to choose only two of those fascinating activities, but I made a decision, which is Golf and Photography. Since my hobby is taking photos I am very interested in this field and have studied by myself about it. But Golf is an absolute new trial. I can imagine myself playing Golf in those beautiful Californian golf-courses. Even though I'm poorly skilled.###It was very difficult to choose only two of those fascinating activities, but I made a decision, which is Golf and Photography.

It was a pity that I had no chance to learn how the sound system works, which I was mostly interested in.

Although it was not easy to choose two activities from your list I decided to do Singing and Surfing. It is difficult to say how good I can sing but I really like it and I think I am not too bad.

Dear Sirs!###Dear Sirs,
First I want to thank you for all the congratulations, and I'll try to answer all your questions about, for instance, travel and accomodation. I have to tell you that for me it is only possible to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at this time. Another question was about the accommodation. I have to tell you that I'd prefer a tents. For me tents are a kind of back to basic living and I like this very much. In my opinion people should become more familiar with the rules of nature.###First I want to thank you for all the congratulations, and I'll try to answer all your questions about, for instance, travel and accommodation.

In my opinion, I do agree with this expression. One of the most unforgettable habit of city life is going out for shopping. I used to hang around famous cloth shops looking at the new arrival clothes section. It is not only a good fun to see the new fashions and things but it also decrease the amount of money in my pocket.###I do agree with this statement.

Sometime shopping doesn't give anything to you but always waste all your free time. A group of girls can spend their time in a shopping center forever. It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexs nowadays are more attractive and combine every facilities inside. From my point of view, someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy.###Sometimes shopping doesn't do anything for you but only wastes all your free time.

To my mind, the class attending a lesson must be shown at first. It evoques the reason of our presence here and it is a cliché; can not.

And from August on I planed to do some part-time job in order to earn some pocket money.###To begin with, I would like to travel in July.

Referring to the possibilities of accommodation, I'd prefer log cabins to tents. Firstly, log cabins are more comportable than tents. Secondly, I do not like tents. Last not least, I always have backache after sleeping in a tent for a couple of days.###Referring to the possibilities of accommodation, I'd prefer log cabins to tents.

As I had been asked to choose two activities I would like to do during my stay at the camp, I chose Golf and singing. I have never played Golf actually, but I would love to try something new. As for singing, I am very keen on singing as I get lessons in it. I just love singing.###As I have been asked to choose two activities I would like to do during my stay at the camp, I chose Golf and singing.

Lastly, does the prize include pocket money? If not, I will have to bring some with me. Is there a possibility of exchanging different currancies to US dollar?

When you think of shopping, it reminds you of going out (mostly) with friends, looking for new things like clothes, accesoires etc. and buying them. It sounds nice and shopping is great fun - or it should be.###When you think of shopping, it reminds you of going out (mostly) with friends, looking for new things like clothes, accessories etc. and buying them.

Nowadays shopping can be very stressful. It all starts with the search of an appropriate parking-space which can last annoyingly long, especially at weekends.###Nowadays shopping can be very stressful.

Nevertheless, the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage, which is terribly crowded. You cannot make a step without "touching" the others. It gets enormously unbearable in hot summer days, when the temperature increases. In such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring. But the worst moment comes, if you cannot find the thing you were looking for, because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out.###Nevertheless, the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage, which is terribly crowded.

I would like to travel in July because it's the only month I have two weeks holiday during the summer. I would prefer to be in a log cabins because I feel insecure staying in a tent. While I'll be at the Camp, I would like to play tennis and go swimming. I've done it for many years and I want to do both once a day. I'm very good at swimming and my level of proficiency is medium at tennis. If possible, could you let me know what I'll need, for example which clothes I must take and how much I can expect to spend.###I would like to travel in July because it's the only month I have two weeks' holiday during the summer.

Dear Kim, I want to tell you about my good experience I had last month. I'd enjoyed helping at a pop concert and it has been fabulous. At first, I'd helped them to carry the material and we had fixed everything in the good order. They were so many pieces that we had spent a whole day to prepare the scene. At the end, we have had a beer and we talked together. I was astonished to see so friendly and funny they were and we got good friends. During the show, I was behind them and I could see the spectators shouting and jumping with their and up. It was unbelievable to realize that I'd worked with stars and that they were my friends. It is difficult to explain what I'd particularly liked about my experience because the most memories are in my heart and I'd never thought that I could get on so well with a group of people which I'd known only for a few days.###Dear Kim, I want to tell you about a good experience I had last month.

I would be grateful if you could book a tent for me at Camp California because I am a nature lover and the idea of outdoor-sleeping really makes me happy. Concerning the activities, as a matter of fact tennis is my favorit sport and I am very keen on it, for the second activity I would like to enroll in surfing, because my husband, who is already a proficient surfer, keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport, and I think it is worthwile trying, therefore I'd love to be in the beginners group.###I would be grateful if you could book a tent for me at Camp California because I am a nature lover and the idea of sleeping outdoors really makes me happy.

Who does not like shopping?

Frankly, if I had a lot of money I would have spend my entire life to do shopping. Although I am the one who loves shopping, I can not stand on the Easters, the Christmas and Sundays, because those days are suitable for anyone to consume the food, buy some presents etc. However, everyone prefers to do the same thing and at the same time. it causes over crowded shops, high-pitch noise, a lack of parking place and if you have to go shopping with a child, the whole thing matters just about enough to drive you crazy. Despite knowing the difficulty we do not resist to do shopping in those days. On the other hand, some companies offer special service, such as sending your order with the post or taking it on the telephone. It could be the solution, avoid busy hours or days, do not bring your child with you, choose the right shop which has a park.###Frankly, if I had a lot of money I would have spend my entire life to do shopping.

And for me, I think a tents would be better, I don't know why but, I feel more comfortable. I think it's because the last time I travelled (with my friends), we stayed at log cabins, and when I was sleeping I felt some thing moving in my skin, then I work up frightened and when I openned my eyes, I saw lots of big ants! After that day, I've never stayed at a log cabin. Yeah, I think that's why!###And for me, I think a tent would be better. I don't know why but, I feel more comfortable.

Generations of young South Africans, black, white or brown, will be reminded of one of the worst times their country went through. Steve Biko and Donald Woods will be remembered always. Steve Biko for becoming a martyr to the black freedom movement of these dark years. A peaceful man who was caught up in the wills of the apartheid regime, dying such a violent death. Donald Wood for literally jumping over his own shadow and risking his life and that of his family in the process of reporting the vile crimes of the SA. police force. In the end he had to leave the country of his birth to escape imprisonment.###Generations of young South Africans, black, white or brown, will be reminded of one of the worst times their country went through.

I would like to travel in July because my examinion will be finished on June 15th. And I have a plan to go to visit my parents in Bangkok, Thailand, in the middle of August. So, I think July is the best time to go for the Camp. In addition, the weather may be nice at that period of time. For accommodation, I would prefer tents because I get used to it. Because I'm not good at sporting, so I will choose singing and photography as my activities. When I was studying in the university I joined the Photo Club where I a taking photo. As I love singing and always spend my free time in Karaoke to practise, I think my singing is not too bad.###I would like to travel in July because my examations will be finished on June 15th.

Now, I hate shopping because I spent a lot when I was young, as mentioned so it came to the conclusion that shopping is a way to waste the time and money. I found that it's not worth when I went to the southern part of Thailand 3 years ago where I met an old man and his little grandson. They are very poor. The money that I spent on shopping can help them a lot if I would not do it before. Little grandson tried to help his grandfather, who was 70 years, old by hiring himself out as a gardener after school, though he was only 10 years old. This thing tell me shopping is not enjoyable any more.###Now, I hate shopping because I spent a lot when I was young, as mentioned.

Only those who gets good marks can take part in theese activities, so sport activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basket ball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent. It would be nice to film an Ancient Greek Poetry lesson because the Ancient Greek teacher is very good at explaining; she is excellent at catching our attention and she wants everyone to tell the class the impressions and emotion they have reading Saffo, Alceo, Alcmone....###Only those who get good marks can take part in these activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.

When I was at the supermarket last week, I suddenly decided not buying from a supermarket at all. First of all, you need a lot of time, because the market is so big. Secondly, you have a lot of choises and you do not know which one to buy. Lastly, there is a recyling problem, which many people do not care about. You buy a lot of items without thinking where should go so much rubbish. For instance, I think a lot about this issue, and sometimes I do not even want to spend water, although I should do it. I think I am too sensible.###When I was at the supermarket last week, I suddenly decided not to buy from a supermarket at all. First of all, you need a lot of time, because the shop is so big.

For accomodation, I would prefer to have a log cabin, it would be better to let money or anything in without thinking of theft. I've always dreamed about climbing but I never have the opportunity to discover this sport. When I saw that you propose this sport, I was really excited. So I choose climbing as a beginner. For the second activity, I will choose sailing. I've done sailing for more than ten years and I really enjoy it. Moreover I was a sailing teacher on summers the past few years.###Regarding accommodation, I would prefer to have a log cabin.

Life at school is made of several things. first, lessons are the most important part of what school wants to provide us with. But there are also a lots of clubs and activities that take part in the daily life of pupils. That's why they both have to be taken in account in the video we will make.###Life at school is made of several things.

The most interesting lessons for pupils are lessons in which we can do something real, concrete. for example, the lessons of mechanics or physics are very interesting. And especially the practical work. It would be great if we show it in our film, it might be also very interesting to watch it.###The most interesting lessons for pupils are lessons in which they can do something real, concrete.

Generally, women like shopping. They like looking for fashionable clothes, bags, shoes and so on. In the bargain season, all shops are full of people who are keen on finding stuffs which are good value for money. You can see battles between two people who want the same thing sometimes. The most interesting thing is that many men are waiting for their wives or girlfriends outside the shop during shopping. They don't fancy going into the crowdy shop. It is very boring and tiring to be kept waiting.###Generally, women like shopping. They like looking for fashionable clothes, bags, shoes and so on.

I ought to let you know that I can only travel in the second week of July, because that is when my winter holidays start. To answer another of your questions, I am more likely to want to stay in a log cabin, considering that I will be two weeks in the camp. They are much more comfortable than tents.
While I am at the camp I would love sailing and climbing. I have not done any of these activities before, but now that I have the chance I want to take advantage of it. I would be very glad if you could let me know what kind of clothes should I take, and how much money do you think I will need to bring with me.###While I am at the camp I would love sailing and climbing.

The list of activities that you have is very interesting so my choice was very difficult to make but I have finally decided to chose sailing because I have been sailing for five years now and enjoy it very much. My second choice is climbing because I have never climbed and would like to have a go at it.###The list of activities that you have is very interesting so my choice was very difficult to make but I have finally decided to choose sailing because I have been sailing for five years now and enjoy it very much.

The nightmare starts when you find out that the items you like the most are also the most expensive.

I would be able to travel only in July because I have a job at the moment, but it will be my vacation in July. I would prefer to be in tents, so that I could enjoy a nature life more than being in log cabins. Moreover, it would be more exciting for me.###I would be able to travel only in July because I have a job at the moment, but it will be my vacation in July.

It was a wonderful chance for me. As you know, I love music. Before the concert started, I cleaned the stage for the singers and I gave some drinks to the singers. Finally, I cleaned the stage again.

The end-of-conference party will take place on a boat cruising on the lake. It will start by a speech from the Director of the conference, followed by a meal.

As nights may be cold at this time of the year, may I suggest that you take with you a pullover.

Of course it allows us to be reached everywhere (even in places you wouldn't want.) For rescue teams, it is a great help. But isn't it a handicap outside professional life. Shouldn't people communicate with those they are next to instead of calling someone 2 miles away. It is not rare to see two people walking side by side, both talking on the phone. Wouldn't it be better to prepare the shopping list instead of dialing home to ask which salad to buy.###Of course it allows us to be reached everywhere (even in places you wouldn't want).

First of all, the efficiency of the society has been improved. When shopping, we don't need to wait for the Kasse to take every article's note by hand. When booking a airline, we can just simply make a phone to any agency, and get it done in one minute. Secondly, instead of looking up tons of books to get the information what we need, we can very easily search for it from the internet or on the local network. It's a very often heard, that someone, who has a special illness, gets an operations by a foreign institutes, which he find via the internet. Moreover, with computer network, it can be possible that people work from home, making projects, controling operations or having conferences. Lastly the way of communications has been also changed. Instead of the tranditional telecommunication, we can talk by, mail or even see each other with the help of a computer network.###First of all, the efficiency of the society has been improved.

Of course there're also some aspects in which the computer technology need to be improved. For example, reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as reading on papers. A very important and severe problem is the reliability and security. Till now, to completely rely on computer is still somehow not safe enough.###Of course there're also some aspects in which the computer technology needs to be improved.

First of all, we have booked the Palace Hotel for your group. This hotel is quiet and near the conference building. However, I would suggest going by bus from the hotel to the conference because this is the most convenient form of transport. Furthermore, as usually, we would organise a party at the end of the conference, therefore, it would be great if your students wear a suit (for a man) or a skirt (for a woman). Furthermore, this party would be in your hotel like in the following years. Finally, there are a lot of mouseum is our town, therefore, I would suggest going to the frogs museum, which is really fashinating.###First of all, we have booked the Palace Hotel for your group.

At First, this international student conference has the intension of explain to students how important is the education. In addition to this, we choose the luxuery Palace Hotel, which is comfortable enough and in a good location. The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city, so you can go by train, by bus or by car. I suggest you should go by train and go out in the Museum Station. The Conference will happen in the Hotel, which is so much easier.###First, this international student conference has the aim of explaining to students how important education is.

However, the invention of the airplane has brought us some facilities. How could a person come from Brazil to Australia without it? Maybe by boat, but it could take too long! The best way is definetely, by air. After this invention travel around the world is so much easier.

If you take your uniform with you it would be pleasant to leave it at the hotel. and wear something else.
There are many things you could do for this short time on the last day. You could visit our famous Museum of Art or go for a walk along the lake. If you want to do something for fun or entertainment, go bowling.###There are many things you could do for this short time on the last day.

Madrid is a big city and have many interesting places. But the best place for me is "La Vaguada". An entertainment and commercial building.###Madrid is a big city and has many interesting places. But the best place for me is "La Vaguada", an entertainment and commercial building.

The building itself is a large building. It is very safe as there are policemen and cameras. The buildings seems to be very new but it is quite old. People love this place and called it "Madrid-two".###The building itself is a large building. It is very safe as there are policemen and cameras.

I receved your letter and I'm happy to help you. We booked the Palace Hotel for your group, it's nice and quiet. I'm sure you'll be fine here. We chose the Palace Hotel because it's near our college, too. So you are going to come at the conference in some minutes.

At the end-of-conference party it'll be something to eat and to drink. In the big room where we'll have the party, it'll be some picturs of our college, you'll see al the generations who passed through here. The wears aren't very important, but it'll be fine if the people will wear something different from the usual jeans.###I received your letter and I'm happy to help you.

Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is only 2 miles away from our college. The college will arrange for a mini-bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45, so you can arrive to the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15. The reason we don't suggest you to take a walk from your hotel is that you'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students.###Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is only 2 miles away from our college.

To my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has been invented in a car. Cars take a big part in our life. Everywhere you look you can see cars. More and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport. Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport. You don't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy wear for a late bus, or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs, you can just jump into a car, tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation.###In my personal opinion one of the most important and useful things which has been invented is the car.

Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as a fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill. Could you imagine if our police, doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot? I don't think I need to comment on this.###Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as a fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill.

From my personal experience I realised how it's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa. I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I couldn't drive at that time. Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live. I couldn't just go for a walk, it was too dangerous. There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time, and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else. There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality of life for my daughter and myself.###From my personal experience I realised how it's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa.

Secondly, the conference is a very important event for all of us, we agree to wear formal dresses. For example, men should wear suits, ties and the so on. In addition, at the end-of-conference party, we also have a country dancing show.

I think a car is very important to me because it's very convenient for everyday life. For example, I can travel to many places in the U.K. Especially, since I live in Whitwell-on-the-Hill (a village near Malton in North Yorkshire). Can you imagine if I hadn't got a car how could I go shopping, go to college and so on?###I think a car is very important to me because it's very convenient for everyday life.

In fact, there are buses (number 843 and 845) which go pass my village but the bus fares is very expensive for me.

The car has largely affected my own life. I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than by use public transports. I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music, which I brought some cassets with me from Thailand. I took a car driving theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a pratice driving test very soon. I think I have to drive the car myself, so that it will know more about the advantages of using the car.###The car has significantly affected my own life.

The hotel that we booked was the Palace Hotel, which is near the bus station. When you are in the bus station you will catch the bus number 37, which will go to the town center. From there you will walk until the college because it is easier to get there that way than to get with another bus. Anyway the college is the first road on your right from the town center.###The hotel that we booked is the Palace Hotel, which is near the bus station.

The hotel which we have reserved for your group is the Palace Hotel. It is not far from our college, taking 20 minutes by car.

There is a taxi rank opposite the hotel.###The hotel which we have reserved for your group is the Palace Hotel. It is not far from our college, taking 20 minutes by car.

Firstly, for your information, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located on the town centre. Students can take the airport bus to the hotel directly when you arrive. And the best way to get from there to the conference is to by coach, as there are about 35 internationternational students, and they are all strangers here. Therefore it is no good taking a bus. I will help you to book the coach.###Firstly, for your information, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located in the town centre.

Most of the Students found this building very particular, because it reflects our history, tradition and culture. If you visit the building, you will get the impression, the feeling, that you are in the past times. This building attracts a lot of people, - because it has a very particular style with majestic, antique windows.###The students, who were questioned said that there are a lot of interesting buildings in our city.

At first, I'd like to tell you that the hotel where you going to stay is "The Palace Hotel", wich is situated at the center of the town. It can't be difficult to find, because it is very near of the conference. Also there is a bus provided for the organisation to take all the students at the hotel. At the end of the conference it will be a party. I might suggest you to wear a casual dress, because many students feels like relaxing after the whole day sitting and listening all the conference. The party is amazed by a group of musicians, and as I remembered from last year it was unforgiven, because all the people where dancing and having a lot of fun.###First, I'd like to tell you that the hotel where you are going to stay is "The Palace Hotel", which is situated at the centre of the town.

It is a well-situated town with a lot of museums to visit, especially "the History museum", wich I visited last year, and I think you can enjoy it as well. It doesn't take a lot of time to visit and the entrance is free.###It is a well-situated town with a lot of museums to visit, especially "the History Museum", which I visited last year, and I think you will enjoy it as well.

Also, I was asking too many people in the street. Could you live without a telephone? The answer was all the same: "Imposible".

At last, if you have some free time for a couple of ours, you'd better visit Kamakura City, which is 30 minutes from our campus by train. That is a very traditional Japanese city where so many temple and heritages are there. I'm sure you'll enjoy it and maybe get familier with our culture.###Last, if you have some free time a, you should visit Kamakura City, which is 30 minutes from our campus by train.

These days, we've been sorrounded with so any different kinds of products which our ancestors invented. In our daily life, however, we seldom notice how much convinient a life we've got or, what is more, how much inconvinient our grandparents had got. How nasty we are!

As for me, the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer. I have been a full time student in the university at home, and their classes all requires us to have personal computer and use them at any times. When you take the class on computer programming, you will definetly need one and it holds true for the class on politics, because you have to study statistic on your computer for doing social research and some analysys. My professor said, 'go and get familier with your computer, otherwise you'll fail'.###As for me, the invention which is most important to me is the personal computer.

I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we useually use without any questione. That's the nature of human being. But, I think it's not only our fault but the evidence of how much they integrate themselves in our life.###I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we usually use without any question.

Firstly, the hotel in which the group is going to stay is the 'Palace Hotel'. Secondly, the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the conference is by a local bus. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and a no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference. Thirdly, the end-of-conference party would be a small disco, with a variety of drinks and food provided. Therefore, you could wear something quite casual.###Firstly, the hotel in which the group is going to stay is the 'Palace Hotel'.

We are nearly always surrounded by the 'man-made' light. With it, we read, study, walk, and so on. In the past people relied on the sunlight, moonlight and the light from fire. These were, however, very unreliable when the weather was bad and when the fuel ran out. They had to read, study and walk in the dark. Today, this kind of thing hardly ever happens! Well, unless there wasn't anything wrong with the power supply.###We are nearly always surrounded by the 'man-made' light. With it, we read, study, walk, and so on.

I remember when I was about 5, I visited a museum with my family. While I was in the toilet, all the light was turned off! I screamed and cried since I'd never experienced being in a complete darkness before. When the light was turned on again, I realised how important even a single light bulb would be, and I was sure I can never, ever live without it.###I remember when I was about 5, I visited a museum with my family.

Imagine how your life would be if you woke up one morning and found that all the electricity had gone. How would you manage to get yourself ready to go to work.

Thank god for those who had created the electricity and had appliedapplied it into every appliances. The electricity is a clever invention. Everything bases on the use of electricity, for instance from a little bulb light to the most complicated computer system which stored priceless information!

I, personally, couldn't live without the electricity. It has already affected and play a great role in my life. I watch the television and use the computer everyday.

In my life the car has an enormous influence. I come from a rural area. The next city is 15 km away and there is no acceptable bus - or rail connection to go there. It has been quiet hard to me not to have the opportunities for my free time like my friends that lived in or near the city. I just had no possibility to meet them after school, because I had no vehicle to get there. I always needed my Mom or my Dad to take me where I wanted to go.###In my life the car has an enormous influence. I come from a rural area.

Yes, it is the TV. It is well known in almost all families,  often with a lot of different channels.
First of all, the TV can tell us news in a short time, about what happened all over the world. Another point in favour of the invention for the TV is, that they telling about interesting reports, for instance about animals or the different culture from other countrys. Furthermore they have a lot of different programme, usually something for everybody. It could be also relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work.

The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in the end of the 19th century. It was an invention nobody thought how important and how widespread it would be in the future. Nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone, and calling to relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing.

When I was a child, we had no telephone at home, and I always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village. Now I have my own flat, and the first piece of furniture I've bought was the telephone. I'll never take it away from my home.###When I was a child, we had no telephone at home, and I always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village.

When I was a child I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I liked, but it was nearly impossible to have them. I felt the lack of them. I first bought a computer as I was in university. It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer. At That time I met the magic world of computers. Linking to the internet was so popular.

Your group has been booked in the Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London. Personally, I am glad that you will have this opportunity to use its various facilities. It is based in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference. In my oppinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line. However you would take bus number 150, if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you have some free time also.###Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London.

The hotel which your students' group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel. It is fairly easy to get there from the conference.

As you already possibly know, the end-of-conference party will take place at the main reception room at the same hotel. You should be there by 7 o'clock in the evening. Answering your question, you should be fine wearing casual clothes.

INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES!###INVENTIONS HAVE AFFECTED ALL OUR LIVES!
The invention without no doubt, that has affected my own life by far is the car. Cars have definitely changed all our lives, and I am not refering only in a positive way, but in a negative way as well. Picture this: a big city such as London or New York with no cars on their streets. Could you imagine it? To be honest, I can't. Cars are part of our daily lives. Traffic jams make people nervous, and sometimes really upset and violent. But, anyway, people use cars.###any, that has affected my own life the most is the car.

Traffic jams make people irritable, and sometimes really upset and violent. But, people use cars, anyway.
If we don't use them we suffer from them. In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car. I really need it to escape from the pollution, mainly caused by cars and any other four-wheel motored vehicle. Isn't that contradictorious? To go to the countryside and being able to breath fresh, non-polluted air, I use my car, which, as far as I am concerned, does not help to maintain a clean air at all.###If we don't use them we suffer because of them.

It is a fact, that the modern society have created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information. Taking it into consideration I would like to say that the computer is the priceless invention for an accountants, designers, engineers and so on and on. Another point in their favour is the possibility to connect to the Internet. It allows you to have all the necessary information "on your fingertips". Also not least importantly is the role of computers in the process of production in factories around the world.###It is a fact, that the modern society has created the demand for an ability to cope with the vast amounts of information.

On the other hand there are some disadvantages. For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world, which computers create. Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people's labour, which leads to the increasing of unemployment.###On the other hand there are some disadvantages.

When I was small, we lived in country yard, I remembered, we used to have oil lamps which used a cotton string dipping in the oil in the small bottle and made it burned the tip of the cotton string to give us light during the night time, it was very little light on, and there were many things we couldn't do under the light from the oil lamps because the light range was very small. There was no any light outside our house, and no light on the road or field either. I was always very scared whenever or wherever I was. because most places. Covered. This scaring dark is still affecting my life now. I never stayed out after dark today except accompanying by my family.###When I was small, we lived in country yard.

You will find there an amazing collection of old weapon, armores and, we are especially pround of it, the great collection of swords.###And if you climb to the top of the main tower - the keep - you will see unforgettable views of a white town.

After that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurands located at the New Castle . I am sure that should be enought for a one day trip. For you information I can say that at this time we have a five weeks festival and this night there will be a great display. That should complete that amazing day.###After that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurants located at the New Castle . I am sure that should be enough for a one-day trip.

Firstly, let me explain the way from the PALACE HOTEL, where your group will be staying, to the conference. The hotel is located in the centre of Seoul, therefore there are many ways to get to the conference. The easiest way to get there is to take the underground, which takes about 20 minutes. The map will be given to you on the day of your arrival.###Firstly, let me explain the route from the PALACE HOTEL, where your group will be staying, to the conference.

As the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of the nature, the palace had a huge garden, however it was destroyed by the army of Japan, and now there remains only a part of the original palace. There is a special monument for the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army.###As the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of the nature, the palace had a huge garden, however it was destroyed by the Japanese army, and now there remains only a part of the original palace.

The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located in the central area of the city, so it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be progressed. The easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take buses 461 or 176 (the bus stop is opposite to the hotel) or we can hire a minibus for you but there is an extra charge for it.###The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located in the central area of the city, so it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be held.

Some people say that many of important inventions in our live are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them. First of all they say about the enviroment pollution which cars and other vechicles make, overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some others problems. But to my opinion if peoples inventions take a place in our lifes they are right then. I think the telefone is the most important thing in many people's lifes as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter wherever you are (I am talking about mobile phones, which now have a majority of our choice). Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems. An electric lamp was an important invention a hundred years before (but for that time it was like a revolution). I think it wouldn't be possible to survive for us without an eclectric life. Because of shipbuilding development people could make all the geographical discoveries, and an automobile transport is an undenyable neccecerity in our life.###Some people say that many of important inventions in our life are not so good and useful as we have got used to think them.

Ceartainly it would be just like mine. Because I live in a rural area, far from any village, town, or city center. The nearest civilization takes me 1 hour on foot. I have no car, and no local bus service to use. Even comeing to Basingstoke seems like a international journey to me. And ofcause this stops me everytime to live sociable life. But also I'm aware of that the time flies for me. I must do whatever I want befor it is too late.

Imagine life without a phone. You are on the road, you have a car accident. What are you going to do without a phone? On another situation, your son is ill, he needs help urgently. I am sure, the phone has saved many lifes. Besides, it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum, only for chating in any time. Thanks to the phone, it is possible even your mam is on the other end of the Earth.###Imagine life without a phone. You are on the road, you have a car accident.

To be honest, the next great invention of people, the computer, can't work, if you haven't got the phone. So I am very grateful to the man, who invented it, unfornutely, I have forgotten his name.

It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed a necessary condition in some professional activities. Trades, politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs. However, the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes, when in the hands of a high-school student.###It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has become a necessary condition in some professional activities.

It becomes then a real obsession for the average students, as e uses it before the lessons, during the lessons, during lunch and, especially, during examinations... Nevertheless, it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam, since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss everyday's.

As I've just checked and the group has been booked into The Palace Hotel. The best way to get from there to the conference is by coache, that I have arranged for you. The driver, Mr. Olsson, works for us since. He will pick you up at 11 oo a.m. The conference is from 12 oo to 2 oo p.m. At the end of the conference there is a party from 2 oo to 3 oo.

We were driving motocycles for a few day befour we finally had got to our mitting points.###Let me to tell you, how the invention of the motorcycle has affected my life.

I really enjoy driving my motocycle. People say that it is dangerous, I don't think so. When I drive it is only me and my motocycle. Before me and after are my friends, that I like and trust. And around me is the nature, that I can watch and enjoy while we shop fore a camp. We can go to any place we like, avoid traffic and to full buses, trains, etc.###I really enjoy riding my motorcycle.

And around me is the countryside, which I can watch and enjoy while we look for a camp. We can go to any place we like, avoiding traffic and to crowded buses and trains, etc.
I am really greatful for the people who invented the first motocycle in the world. I feel very bad about the fact that I don't know who was it. On the other hand no matter that I feel very good about that because that invention has changed and affected my life end the people I care about, it has affected my life in a very best way.###I am really grateful to the people who invented the first motorcycle in the world.

The hotel that your group will be staying at is the Palace Hotel. It is reasonably near to the college, so it may be very good to walk from the hotel along the River Thames following the yellow signs on sunny days. If it rains, you can take the bus 54 that stops in front of the college.###The hotel that your group will be staying at is the Palace Hotel.

If you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them, it must be clear to you that the invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives. For example, all infrastructures, such as public transports and power stations, are ran using computers, the government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country, and all kids of services and businesses, such as hospitals and supermarkets, use them as essential capitals. In other words, almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers. So I am sure from this that it is convincing enough to say that invention of computers is really important.###If you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them, it must be clear to you that the invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives.

From my personal experience, I can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool. It improves the productivity of my homework, that is often essay writing, and also it allows me to access to the internet. Since I live abroad, the internet is really useful for me to have a contact with my bestfriend and when I want to know what is going on in my home country.###From my personal experience, I can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool.

There are two parts of Liverpool Street Station that make it so interesting a building. The newly decorated section is fairly modern in style with escalators and touched-screen ticket machine. It is also very well linked into the old underground station, which it is such a contrast in transformation. The old bit is rather unique and charming.

There is another surprising section in this building. At the far back of the station it is also connected to a spacious, well designed pedestrians park.

Who of you could imagine life without the telephone? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you can't attend her garden party because of an illness, without having to look her in the eye? When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea of how popular it would be one day. Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person. Nowadays, however, the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it.###Who of you could imagine life without the telephone?

"Televisions is just an amazing invention." My good friend said that. I agree with her. Firstly, televisions make us know more about the world without travel it all. If there are no televisions, we won't know what are the other countriesthe other countries were like, or even what language they speak, unless we go to that country.###"Television is just an amazing invention."

Secondly, for some points, it can educate young children. Many TV programmes are especially made for children, such as "Learn follow me" and "Be good to others". Actually, they are quite good programmes and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child.###Secondly, in some ways, it can educate young children.

The last but not least, it is a good kind of entertainments. Maybe you will think that playing basketball, going to cinemas and discos are much better that staying at home sitting in front of an object. However, televisions can bring you the fun that other activities can't.

REASONS OF RECOMMENDATION.###REASONS FOR RECOMMENDATION.
The principal reason is the cheapest price. You pay only to FRS for the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want. On the other hand, if you are more than 10 people, you can have a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person. It seems that this solution might be the best way to visit this museum.###The principal reason is the cheap price. You pay only to FRS for the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want.

The group has been booked into the King Hotel at High Street, which is very easy to find. And the best way to get from there to the conference is by following the rod in front of the hotel to the right, then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side. After that walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference place, which is called the White House.###The group has been booked into the King Hotel on High Street, which is very easy to find.

Firstly, we've booked Palace Hotel, which is located in Central. The best way to get from the hotel to the conference its using the tube because it takes only 20 mininute.

Computer is the most important invention in our life.###The computer is the most important invention in our life.
Some people might say the electricity is more important than any another thingh. It's hard to say which is the most important invention. However, I'd say the computer is a more amazing invention rather than another inventions such as the telephone, the car. Recently the computer is really necessary and we can't manage to work without them. Not only is for bussiness, but also in for my life. For instance, when I want to contanct with to my friend, it's quite helpful by using e-mail. Before the computer had been invented, we couldn't possibly have lots of information easily and we couldn't contact with to foreign countries at the same time.###Some people might say the electricity is more important than any other thing.

If I were in your shoes, I would choose the position to the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same, I think that this choice is the best for you. But you should wonder which working place is more convenient to you. You'd do better not to travel far away from your home. Also working in a museum may include big tips from the tourists.

I think, it is a wonderful idea to organize such festivals each year, because it is very interesting to learn some news about life in other countries.###I think, it is a wonderful idea to organize such festivals each year, because it is very interesting to learn some news about life in other countries.

I extremely liked all the concerts, shows, and exhibitions, but why there weren't any photograph exhibitions? I think, you should make some next year.

As you know, I'm studying at the private Academy, so the rules in my institute are different from the rules in state institutes. I'll give you an example. In our Acadamy we are not allowed to smoke. The fine for smoking on the Academy is territory is 100 dollars. So nobody smokes there. I don't smoke, so I don't care about this rule. But some of my friends really would like to change it. You also wanted to know about what I'm allowed or not allowed to do at home. Well, I have rather modern parents, so they don't prohibit me to go to the discoes or somewhere with my friends. The only rule for me at home is to walk out with my dog three times a day.###As you know, I'm studying at a private Academy, so the rules in my institute are different from the rules in state institutes.

The festival was excenent in many ways, and especially it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea. I assume that this fact attracted people very much. In addition to that, organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good. I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets with the proper price to come to the festival. Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic.###The festival was excellent in many ways, and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea.

I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets at the normal price to come to the festival. Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic.
However, I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year. The festival was supposed to be an international one, but the artists and stars  who participated in it were from six countries only. Thus, I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited. Also, some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of audiences. I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls. Furthermore, I found that there were not many genres of neither the films nor the plays. So I suggest you have various kinds, and more numbers of plays and films next year.###However, I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year.

People all have different opinions about books. Some prefer realistic stories whereas others do unusual ones. But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea'.###People all have different opinions about books.

Above all, realistic stories teach me something of the life, or at least influence me. As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book. Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging to everything he faces. When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up on taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him. Real stories have huge impacts on me, and affect me a lot, often in good ways.###Above all, realistic stories teach me something about the life, or at least influence me.

In addition to that, realistic stories are more attractive, I personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they cannot be true. But, while reading realistic stories, I just fall deep into the story, into the writer's own world. Ernest Hemingway's sentences are precise, but still very powerful and alive. So when I read about other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught, I got very angry and annoyed. Realistic stories thus, develop our imagination and creativity, which are essential in our lives.###In addition to that, realistic stories are more attractive, I personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they cannot be true.

Firstly, concerning the stars and artists, they came from only six countries. For musics like jazz and rock, it was excellent but for classical concerts we had a problem. Because some concert halls were too small. If you have any ideas about  bigger halls, it will be better.###Firstly, concerning the stars and artists, they came from only six countries.

It began when my parent sand I were going to the South of France for our holidays. We took a by car. When we were near Geneva, my father, who was driving the car, had been flashed by a radar and the police stopped him. After that, as it maked a long time that he drove, so we decided to stop to an service area. We were going to the toilet and ate something to the snack bar. Suddenly, my father realised he forgot to close the car. He ran but it was too late, somebody had stolen the luggages. We called the police but they said to us that if you didn't close your car we didn't make something.###It began when my parents and I were going to the South of France for our holidays.

When it goes to my home, I think I have the usual duties: I have to clean my room, wash the dishes or vacuum the carpets, but they're not exhausting things, as I share them with my sister and brother.

On the other hand, I would like to notice that the festival would be able to appeal to more people if a few improvements were made. Firstly, you had said in your advertisement that artists from around the world would perform. Actually, they came from only six countries. What is more, some concert halls were too small. As a result, it was impossible for al the audience to fit in there.###On the other hand, I would like to point out that the festival could be able to appeal to more people if a few improvements were made.

In Poland, rules that refer to the ways of being dressed at school aren't very strict; we don't wear any uniforms, but our clothes have to be clean and nice to look at. We can neither eat nor drink during the lessons.

In our school, you're not allowed to eat during class. You must have a permission to get out of your seat or leave the classroom.

In your letter you told me something about rules. I imagine that you want my opinion for your homework ?Don't you?###In your letter you asked me something about rules. I imagine that you want my opinion on your homework , don't you?

I have friends that are studing in other schools and they are very happy with their freedom.

We are not allowed to talk during the lesson and we have to do our homework every day. Usually we don't have to wear school uniforms, but there are schools, in which there is such obligation. In most of the schools students have to change their shoes in order not to make the floor dirty. If I could change anything, I would probably lessen the amount of homework. It's hard to find any spare time sometimes!###We are not allowed to talk during the lessons and we have to do our homework every day.

What about home rules? Well, we both know that parents are the ones who rule at home. All the things we're not allowed to do depend on them. Anyway, I must finish now. Has your dog already recovered?

There are many ways to earn money, specially in a big city, like the one where we are studing all year around. Some examples could be delivering pizzas or newspapers, working as a bartender throug the nights, cleaning services, etc. I usually call these jobs non- cualified positions.###There are many ways to earn money, especially in a big city, like the one where we are studying all year around.

The name of the event, International Arts Festival, is a great idea actually, but there were stars and artists only from six countries apart from your advertisement.

The second point I would like to make is about the concerts which showed people Jazz, rock and classic music, which were fantastic. However, there were some concert halls were too small. Quite few seats were available for the audience, so a few people had to stand and watch the concerts. I see you might not have had much time to be well-organised.###The second point I would like to make is about the concerts which showed people Jazz, rock and classical music, which were fantastic.

Finally, I would like to see the good side of things about the weekend ticket. It is a excellent price because when I am tempt to watch some festivals, obviously it costs much more money. At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommand it to other friends. That's how I am feeling about that.###Finally, I would like to see the good side of things about the weekend ticket.

Nowadays while my country is developing, most people are very busy, so they can't bring up their children. I think the rule of school has many thing stoping students doing. For example, if students behave wrongly at school, they will have some punishments even up to now. What else, unless they pass the exam they have to get extra lesson or test. But most teachers consult with their parents, so it they behave wrongly it is true that teachers call their parents.###Nowadays while my country is developing, most people are very busy, so they can't bring up their children.

Secondly, although the music concerts were good, I think that some concert halls were too small. It was a shame to found that some of them were sold out because of the short number of seats available. However, I really enjoyed the dance shows and the plays and films. I suggest it can be a good idea to set more projections next year. Moreover, in my opinion two days is a short time for this kind of event, and I strongly encourage you to organise a full week festival.###Secondly, although the music concerts were good, I think that some concert halls were too small.

A traditional way to earn money, in the spare time, is to bring newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village. The problems that you have here is the weather.

But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where you're good at, I mean if you're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people.

I must say that the rules aren't the same in the schools of our country. Every school has it's own rules. I think that my school is very democratic and so there are very good relations between teachers and students. We are all very friendly in our class and we help to each other when we have a problem. So the main rule in our school is regarding theachers.###I must say that the rules aren't the same in the schools of our country. Every school has its own rules.

I'm allowed to do many things at home. My parents are very kind, and they know that their son will do everything right.

In my country there are some rules that are the same in all schools. For example, we have to wear in an appropriate way, not talk to each other during the lessons and pay attention to the teachers. At this time, in my school there is a new rule. We aren't allowed to use the mobile phone in class. Before this rule it was funny (new sound in class, phones ring or sing.), but not for our headmaster.###In my country there are some rules that are the same in all schools.

It was a great idea for doing something like that. There were jazz, rock and classical concerts, but some concerts hall were too small for all the people, who took a part at that festival. There were also plays and films, dance shows, which I liked the most, art exhibitions and talks by writers, but it would be good to see more plays and films next year. Also it a great idea was, that it was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events.###It was a great idea for to do something like that.

As you know, I'm not a secondary school's student, I'm now a student of architecture in Krakow. I have lessons from Monday till Friday. On Sathurday and Sunday we don't have lessons, but it doesn't seem that we don't have work. We are allowed to prepare for the next week's lessons. At my school there are a lot of drawings, and paintings, and some other subjects doing by hands. We also learn how to design the interiors and buildings. It's very interesting. We usually have lessons at the morning, till the afternoon. We don't have tests during the whole student year, only at the end of the class. There are also some exams. After a few months we go somewhere with all the class, for example next to the lake, and there we are paintings the nature.###As you know, I'm not a secondary school student, I'm now a student of architecture in Krakow.

When I found the advertisement of the International Arts Festival, I was very excited. It is great to hold an annual international arts festival in the place. Then I spent two days at the festival. I enjoyed it very much. There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world. Jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance show etc. The specified thing that is worth to remind here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourist could offer what they like.###When I found the advertisement for the International Arts Festival, I was very excited.

Although how I enjoyed it, there were still something that needed to be improved. For example, there were some conert halls which was too small to hold so much people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for the audience.

Now I'm a mother of two children. They are all in the school. Comparing to my experience, I want to give them a more open attitude about everything.

But at school, although I hope the teacher don't give students so much homework, and don't forbidden the opposite voice of the students, there are nothing I can do because of our culture.

Actually not all the schools in Turkey are so strict but unfortunatly the school that I'm going to is like a military camp. The uniform, we are wearing has to be perfect. No one is allowed to wear anything which isn't written in the school rules. The general rules which are used in all schools aren't so strict, however there are a few things that need to be changed. For example, if you don't come to school for 10 days in a year, we fail that year.###Actually not all the schools in Turkey are so strict but unfortunately the school that I'm going to is like a military camp.

Thank God it isn't so strict at home. My family allows me almost every thing except smoking and drinking alchol of course, which I don't do anyway. I am allowed to stay up late, I'm allowed to bring my friends home and stuff like that. However there is one thing that my parents don't like me to do. They hate it when I listen to music loudly. I think they don't like the music I listen to.###Thank God it isn't so strict at home. My family allows me almost everything except smoking and drinking alcohol of course, which I don't do anyway.

First of all, I congratulate you on making this kind of event. It was such a good success that some people weren't able to have tickets! You should increase the number of places you give. Therefore, you could invite artists from around the world and not only from six countries: it would be more pleasant.###First of all, I congratulate you on organising this kind of event.

Although I am keen on classical music, I found some concerts halled too small. I was wondering if you could improve that? Also, there were some interesting films but not enough. Perhaps, you could possibly meet some producers, who come from others countries in order to show different cultures.###Although I am keen on classical music, I found some concert halls too small.

I find the reasonably-priced ticket excellent, because there is a lot of people who went to see only one or two events, and by paying for the all events ticket, they might see other events and learn about something they didn't expected to find interesting.

Here in Brazil the rules at school depends on the school. In general, the rules at private schools are much harder than the ones at state schools. In mine, we didn't have many rules. For example, nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom. We were allowed to go out if we didn't want to stay in class. But we had to use the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams.###Here in Brazil the rules at school depend on the school.

the rules at home are very different. I am allowed to do what I want as long as I studie enough to aprove. I think that my parents let me do what I want, because they trust me. they know that if I go out with the car, I will not drink. It is not allways easy, but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them.###The rules at home are very different. I am allowed to do what I want as long as I study enough to aprove.

The idea of making the festival "international" was very good. I could find the opportunity to watch the artists from different countries, but there could have been stars from more than 6 countries. The jazz, classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls were too small. The Plays and films I watched were also excellent, but more could be on the stage next year. I joined the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures. The dance shows made a sight for our sour eyes, they were really fascinating. I learned so many things about the writers and their ideas, not to mention their life styles, by talking to them. Beyond all these, the application of joining in all the activities by one nice-priced ticket was excellent; because it saved you from having buying one ticket for each activity. Next year, I think you should increase the number of shows, concerts and others, and also the time spent at the festival (for example: at least 5 days), then everything would be perfect.###The idea of making the festival "international" was very good.

The things you wrote about the rules made me think for a long time and I understood that some really don't make any sense! The more you obey the rules, the better person you are! Our school is really very diciplined, especially about our clothes and behaviours. I understand the second part, but I can't get the reason of wearing in white an dark blue only. Do we become the "perfect one" then? Then again, we have to obey all these rules. It can be said that I'm much more free at home. I'm allowed to do whatever I want at my room. I can't go out at nights easily, but that is not something that I mind about. There are three main things that are very important for my family: respect, honesty and trust. I think I show these three to them.###The things you wrote about the rules made me think for a long time and I understood that some really don't make any sense!

Most common way to earn money is baby-sitting. Many young people earn their pocket money so, helping neighbouring parents to have a bit more spare time. Other students work as house or office managers, make promontion of different goods or even work as a bouncer.

Firstly, there were stars and artists only from six countries. This number may be increased to attract more and different people. Also some concerts holls were too small for this much people.

We do not have many school rules, and the teachers are rather liberal. We don't have to wear any special uniforms on signs of our school. Some rules are really simple: we must be at school on time, and we must not disturb others during the classes. We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course! In winters we are to change our shoes. It may sound funny, but mud, gravel and snow lying on the school's floors is not a nice sight, so we change our schoes without questioning that rule. I am also used to write exams which are in polish schools very often.###We do not have many school rules, and the teachers are rather liberal.

First of all, as I see it the idea of an Arts Festival is great because in this way many people can know artists who cames from different countries.

Nowadays everybody wants to earn money. Young people know that money make the world go round, so they always look for a job with a big salary. Some people say that the young shouldn't be independent and earn on their own, but I am sure that it's better to work in your free-time than waste it. In my opinion, the young should work rather than wait for their pocket money. There are a lot of possibilities of to earn some money but of course the young are not able to get a well-paid job, because they are not enough experienced and educated. They have to think about some season jobs. Firstly, the good way to earn money is, to help the old. They often are not able to do their shopping or walk the dog. If you help them, they may give you some money as a reward. Secondly, you can find an easy job in a shopping centre. It's better paid and a permanent job. You can work in storage, look after the goods or catch shoplifters. If you are a good mathematic you can be a seller.###Nowadays everybody wants to earn money.

Firstly, in our classroom you can't shout, you must be quite and sat down. You must pay attention always because you don't know if the teacher will ask you some question. In exams, you can't talk to the teacher, either you mustn't eat chuingham or take a walkman with you. In my home I can avoid that rules. My mum only doesn't want me to arrive late. However, I can go dancing whenever I want but I must telling her previously. My mum is a lovely woman and she doesn't know how much I love her because most of the day I'm outside, but that's the true. My father is a bit jealous but agrees with what my mum says.###Firstly, in our classroom you can't shout, you must be quiet and sit down.

Firstly, I found amazing the number of starts and artist who came to the festival although they where from only six countries around the world.

First of all, I must congratulate the people responsible of this good idea. It is known of all the lack of art festivals and cultural activities in general that shows our city. And what a belter thing to solve this than to give the festival an international character.###First of all, I must congratulate the people responsible for this good idea.

But including only six countries in the festival does not seem enough, in my opinion. I think next year you should invite more different countries, because the festival would be more multicultural.###But including only six countries in the festival does not seem enough, in my opinion.

Secondly, there were some problems of accommodation in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small. Another important thing is that, despite the number and quality of films, there were, from my point of view, not many plays. In addition, I would like to talk about the success among most visitors of the weekend ticket, due to its economical price and because of its comodity in use.###Secondly, there were some accommodation problems in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small.

One possible thing is to display in a public place what you can do best, and, then, "sell" it to the people. For example, you can do a dance folk, be Hamlet in the street, or even sing with some of your friends a nice song from you country. You must be aware, anyway, of the difficulty of this kind of things (bad weather, no attention from the people and so on).###One possible thing is to display what you can do best in a public place, and, then, "sell" it to the people.

Secondly, despite the high quality of the concerts, some of the halls they were given in were too small for the crowd of audition.

Another thing that is different from your schools is that we don't change classrooms between periods.

Let me talk about the rules at home. We like chatting on the phone so much that most of us' parents have limited the talking time down to five minutes, threatening to cut off the wires otherwise. Also, as most of us live in flats, we're not allowed to listen to loud music or run or play ball games in the house! But we are legally allowed to play instruments like the piano until 10 p.m.###Let me talk about the rules at home.

I'd love to write more, Mary, but I'm in a real rush nowadays. This month has been full of exams and there are still ones coming up next week, so I must be a swot as you see.

Overall, however, the festival was definitely a great success. I liked the plays and films, and want to see more next year. The special tickets were excellent because we could enjoy the arts without worrying about money. So all you need to improve things is to have larger concert halls. I also suggest that you should make it easier to find out where and what is being held using more notice boards.###Overall, however, the festival was definitely a great success.

The best advantage of this job is the payment. It is very good considering how less time we spend on it. It's about 3,000 yen per hour in my district. It is also attractive that this job rarely affects our university studies. Students who want home teachers are usually primary school, junior high school, or senior high school students, and it means they take lessons after school, not in a daytime. So, in a daytime, we can focus in our studyings.###The best advantage of this job is the pay. It is very good considering how little time we spend on it. It's about 3,000 yen per hour in my district.

It is not so easy for every student, though. Because teaching requires a lot of knowledge. You have to be much smarter than your student, and you also need to prepare for lessons, for it is your responsibility to provide your student with the right information.###It is not so easy for every student, though, because teaching requires a lot of knowledge.

The last thing is that I was very surprised when I read that you have a weekend-price. This is an excellent idea because during the week people don't have too much time to go to the festival.

From my point of view I can complain only on a small concert hall and the fact there were artist from only six countries. Nowadays many people are fond of classical music, but this concert was too small that's why many people had to miss this classical concert.###From my point of view I can complain only about the small concert hall and the fact there were artists from only six countries.

As you know, I finished school two years ago. This year, I started a private school in Dijon. So the rules are clear, you need to participate to the lessons and also be successful at the exam of June 2000. In our class, we don't have a problem with students who dislike to work, because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to say there for years and years. It is also expensive and I can't afford to stay there too long.###As you know, I finished school two years ago. This year, I started a private school in Dijon.

In my sweet home, my parents let me do what I want, because I am an adult now. But when we are in society, we have to be careful not to disturb the other persons. It is the same in our family and for example, my parents dislike hearing music in the whole house or that I let dust everywhere. When I go out, they don't give me an hour to be at home, because I don't exagerate.###In my sweet home, my parents let me do what I want, because I am an adult now.

In conclusion, I don't want to change something in my house or at school, because I totaly agree with the few rules that I have.###In conclusion, I don't want to change anything in my house or at school, because I totally agree with the few rules that I have.

Finally, I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably-priced ticket for the weekend is excellent, we can go where we want to, see what we feel like to.

May I suggest you to think about doing the festival over one week.###Finally, I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably priced ticket for the weekend is excellent.

First of all, and I think it's a big difference with England, children don't wear uniforms at school. I was very surprised when I saw them in your country.

Of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself, be polite with the teacher and the other school children. During the break too, usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you. I think nowadays, children are more free and heard, I mean as regards the contact between them and adults. Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them (though not always) but also speaks with them.###Of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself and be polite with the teacher and the other schoolchildren.

At home it is different, each family has its own rules. As I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay up very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired. But I was a wise child, so! Usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident. There are some rules, like "don't speak with a full mouth"; "don't put your finger in your noise"; "say please and thank you"; "don't fight with your brother"; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere.###At home it is different.

There was an old married couple. They had no children. One day, the lady went to a river to wash their clothes and the man went to a mountain to cut trees. In a bamboo forest, he found a shining piece of bamboo. When he cut it, he found a beautiful baby girl in it. She was named the bamboo princess.###There was an old married couple.

The princess grew up to be beautifully. Some princes proposed to her. But she said to them, "if you want me, you have to do this." and asked them to do impossible things because she didn't want to get married. One day, the old couple saw the princess crying. When they asked her about this, she said, "I am from the moon and I will have to go back soon". They really loved her and they asked a prince who loved the princess to protect her. But, one the day, the princess went back to the moon with guards from the moon although the prince and his army tried hard to protect her.###The princess grew up to be beautiful.

I was very surprised when I knew that the stars and artists were only from six countries. It was too little for this festival.

Another solution could be working as a barman, the problem is that you go to bed very late, but it's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night.

It's a story of a special person who was born in my country and who is now known worldwide. The night he came into this world, was one of grater even if for the habitants of the country or even of the town where he was born, it was a casual night. The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars were lighting up all the land. Only the one who knew how to read stars could actually tell that a great king was born. When the three men saw him, they fell on their knees to worship him. The mother was pride because she knew he was sent from above and he was going to be the one to set people free from their sins. This little man from Israel died as the  hero of all times. His message is still as impacting today and will always be, even if this story happened a long time ago.###It's a story of a special person who was born in my country and who is now known worldwide.

To sum up I want to tell you bout my suggestions for next year's festival. It would be wonderful to buy some books or programms with the signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival. Also I think that the dance shows should include different styles of dancing (e.g. the national dancing of all the countries) to impress the audience and not to bore with the similar scenes.###To sum up I want to tell you about my suggestions for next year's festival.

I am writing to express my profound gratitude for an excellent organisation of an annual international arts festival, where I spent two days. The idea of such a festival is really magnificent and I enjoyed various art exhibitions, talks by writers and dance shows.###I am writing to express my profound gratitude for the excellent organisation of the annual international arts festival, where I spent two days.

However, the festival could be even better next year. Actually, there were stars and artists from six countries and it would be wonderful if you could invite artists from some others places as well for next year's festival. Besides, I was fascinated by the plays and films and you could probably organize some more. Unfortunately, I am afraid that some concert halls where jazz, rock and classical concerts were held were too small and perhaps you could arrange to use bigger ones.###However, the festival could be even better next year.

For a start I would like to say that books offer us a wide range of different life stories, both realistic and unusual, they make us thoughtful and form our outlook, and they make us feel and think.###To start with I would like to say that books offer us a wide range of different life stories, both realistic and unusual, they make us thoughtful and form our outlook, and they make us feel and think.
As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction literature as each masterpiece is unique in its own way despite the fact what sort of book it is. Stories that are realistic help us to understand better our own life and the people around us. However, reading an unusual, sometimes fantastic story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view. I consider "Wuthering Heights" by Emily Brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of our everyday's routine. It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters, and reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death. This book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality. It contributes to the world treasurehouse of literature and arouses an irresistable fascination.###As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction literature as each masterpiece is unique in its own way regardless of the fact what sort of book it is.

I'd like to write about rules in Poland. They're horrible. There are many things we aren't allowed to do at school. At first - we have to be at time. Our lessons start at 8 a.m and we aren't allowed to be late. We have to change our shoes. Fortunately we don't have to wear the school uniforms. We can wear what we want. Most of studenst wear jeans and a sweaters. We have to be quiet during the lessons and our lessons are boring because of it. Our school-bags are very heavy because we have to carry our books, notebooks, atlases and dictionaries all day. It is what I'd like to change. I'd like to leave my books at school. At home we have to do our homework. There's always much to do so we have no free time at all. Our parents want us to be clever. When we have good marks at school they let us to go out (to the disco or cinema, but only on Saturdays and we have to be back by ten). On Sundays we have to go to bed early because on Monday our school starts at 8 in the morning. We sometimes help in the house but it isn't neccessary. We aren't allowed to smoke and drink any alcohol.###I'd like to write about rules in Poland. They're horrible. There are many things we aren't allowed to do at school.

The idea of an "International Art Festival" was great. But I feel the word of "International" was not really suit; because you just only got six countrie's stars and artists came. I think you should invite more than ten countries. The other problem was choosing space. Like the hall of the classical concert was too small and crowded. Next year, you should calulate or examine how many people come before you choose a hall, which I feel very good was plays and films. It can show more for next year's festival. The Dance Shows as well. And the offer of a "weedend ticket" was an excellent idea. Because buy.###The idea of an "International Art Festival" was great.

In spite of having a great time, there were some things I would like to give you my opinion about. Firstly, there was a few stars and artists from only six countries although the advertisement mention that stars and artists would come from around the world. Secondly, some concerts took a place in really small halls. I suggest that concerts should be held in bigger halls than this year's in next year. Therefore, there will be more people coming to the concerts. Finally, food shops should be added in this festival in next year because atrractive.###In spite of having a great time, there were some things I would like to give you my opinion about.

There is a lot of rules at my school. Firstly, we're allowed to drive a car to school, which is quite an unusual rule in a Japanese school because students might crash a car on the way to school or home. I actually love this rule because I don't have to get up early if I have a car. Secoundly, boys are not allowed to have long hire. They have to cut their hair once a month. Girls can't have make up on at school at all. I want to at least put lip coluor on. I wish I could change this rule.###There are a lot of rules at my school.

I must also admit the organization of the festival was perfect. All the guests were offered a weekend ticket for all events.

So, one opportunity is working as a baby-sitter. This job doesn't demand much abilities, but a lot of patience though. In addition to baby-sitting, you may also give some lessons to small children such as (tl) teaching them to read or write or just basic rules and words of a foreign language, Eglish, for example.###So, one opportunity is working as a baby-sitter.

Another way to earn some money is to work as a waiter after classes. This job requires a lot of energy, however. But you can earn more.

What about the rules at home? I can't remember, because now I'm 19, then I can do what I want. I know that I had to ask at my Mum or Dad for going out by my friend after the lessons.

Two sisters, Alex and Daniela, were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking of what they could do. That year, the winter in France was very cold. It was near Christmas and the two girls hadn't found any present for their mother. Offering Christmas presents was a tradition not be forgotten and there were only four days left. Alex suggested that it would be a good idea to go to the city to buy that present. Daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk with this kind of weather. Anyway, Alex was too stubborn to give up and it was like talking to a brick wall: she didn't listen to her sister.###Two sisters, Alex and Daniela, were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking about what they could do.

However, you said "Stars and artists from around the world" in the advertisement. But there were only six countries' candidates. It was exaggerated. Besides, some concert halls were too small. Jazz and classical concerts' halls were especially small. It caused a long queue and I had to waste my time.

Firstly, I did newspaper delivery. I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far much than pocket money. Nevertheless, I lost my concerntration to the study and I spent the money to entertainment. I earned easily and I couldn't control myself at that time. I was only 12 years old.###Firstly, I did newspaper delivery. I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far more than pocket money.

Secondly, I made a brochure for a company when I was in high school. I was studying computer at that time. Also I was leader of the computer user circle in the school so I needed some money for managing the circle. For this reason, I took this kind of part-time job in the company. Despite the fact that it was a part-time job, I worked very hard because I liked computer works. I could earn money, and also I got a career.###Secondly, I made a brochure for a company when I was in high school. I was studying computers at that time.

I am writing to give suggestion for the international art festival, which I have been to one weeks before.

It was really good, but I feel it could be better next year.
Firstly, I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival, it is very interesting, especially for the young people. I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time there very much. It was said that stars and artists from around the world would be there on the advertisement, but in fact they are from only six different countries, so I hope there will be artists from more different countries next year. Although the jazz, rock and classical music was great, some concerts and halls are too small, could you consider making them bigger next year.###Firstly, I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival.

In your last letter you asked me something about our rules, both at home and at school in my country. I'd like to tell you that. In school, we have lots of rules, especially in the class and some of them are quite strange. For example, we can't go to the toliet during the lessons, we should go there in the brake. And we can't eat food or do any sports in our classroom. If you fail three subjects in your exam, you will be kicked out of school. It's too strickt, I don't like it. If I can, I would like to change this, because I don't think everyone can success at once, we should give them a second chance to try.###In your last letter you asked me something about our rules, both at home and at school in my country.

If looking after children doesn't fit you, you can try the same thing with pets. Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk.

When I knew it was going to be an international festival, I got really excited because I would finally have the opportunity to meet stars and artists from around the world, but I felt rather disappointed when I found out that was not at all true. Besides this, I think that some of the concert halls were too small so that I felt very uncomfortable. However, the one-reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all the events was marvellous because I was able to attend as many concerts as I wished without spending much money.###When I found out there was going to be an international festival, I got really excited because I would finally have the opportunity to meet stars and artists from around the world, but I felt rather disappointed when I found out that was not at all true.

Although that Festival was not well-organized, I would like you to repeat it next year. I wish you could perform more plays and films, and there should be more varied art exhibitions. But I really appreciate it if you would take into consideration the problem with the lack of space in the concert halls.###Although that Festival was not well organized, I would like you to repeat it next year.

Personally, I can not imagine human life without rules, especially those that have to do with respecting other people. Moreover, I am in favour of rules at school because it is very important for children to learn how to cooperate with others.###Personally, I cannot imagine human life without rules, especially those that have to do with respecting other people.

As far as I can remember, I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important ones were concerning wearing the suitable clothes, to arrive in time and get on with every teacher and authority figure. As a consequence, most mates used to complain about those rules but all of us tried to put up with them.###As far as I can remember, I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important ones were concerning wearing the suitable clothes, arriving on time and getting on with every teacher and authority figure.

At home it is the other way about. Fortunately, rules are made by every member of the family so that no one complains about them. I must admit that I am able to do whatever I want, such as inviting friends over, watching TV until midnight and so on. In fact, the only strong rule is to cooperate with the house-keeping and meal.

However, I think that some concert halls were too small for the musical performances. You probably did not expect such a big audience! Being very fond of films, I would have appreciate seeing more of them. For next year's edition, you could possibly add some foreign films, like the Chinese ones, which I most like.###However, I think that some concert halls were too small for the musical performances.

I must say that our school rules are quite different than yours. First of all we have to stand up, when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons. If you missed a lesson, that could be a trouble for yourself. I think it depends on the school. Privat schools have a more relaxed atmosphere that the state school. They don't have strike rules and students can take extra lessons.###I must say that our school rules are quite different to yours.

On the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviours are punished. For example, you have to do more homeworks or they are sending you home etc. Of course smoking isn't allowed at any part of the schol.###On the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviour is punished.

The Festival on its own is a great idea because there aren't many of these events dealing with art but I think that instead of inviting stars and artists only from six counties they could be invited really from all over the world.###The festival on its own is a great idea because there aren't many of these events dealing with art but I think that instead of inviting stars and artists from only six counties they could be invited really from all over the world.

The boy had grown and had become very strong when he heard that there were lots of devils on Onigashima Island who robbed many people in Bizen of much money and many treasures. He made up his mind to defeat them, and asked his stepmother for some kibidango, one of traditional snacks in Japan. Having eaten the kibidango, he departed for Onigashima with three friends of him: a dog, a monkey and a bird.###The boy had grown and had become very strong when he heard that there were lots of devils on Onigashima Island who robbed many people in Bizen of a lot of money and a lot of treasure.

I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea, because you can see how other country's art is, but I think in this festival, there were too many country's people. You should pick only six countries, so it won't be very busy and another reason is that the concert hall is too small so that the people can't even dance in classical concerts.###I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea, because you can see how other countries' art is, but I think in this festival, there were too many countries' people.

At schools we have certain rules like being in the class, sitting in your place before the lecture starts, bringing in your equipment with you, keeping quiet during the lessons and raising your hand when you want to talk.

Contrary there are other rules which annoy us like the clothing ones. You should wear the same things every time, no changes and alternations are allowed. It makes us like robots and we feel bad psychologically, because we want to be different and free in what we wearing. Also the attendance rules put a strain on us. If we don't come to school for 10 days, then we can't pass the class.

Firstly, I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events. But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries, not stars from around the world as you announce in your advertisement.###Firstly, I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events.

Secondly, I really enjoyed the jazz and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some of them were taken place in too small concert halls. Thirdly, all the plays and films showed were interesting, In my opinion you should include some more films and plays in your festival next year.

As you tell me in your last letter, you were talking about rules in your class and you want to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home. First, I must tell you that the teachers are strict at school. We aren't allowed to eat in the classrooms and in addition to this we must sit down in individual desks. We can't chat with our classmates. How boring! At home everything is quite good, because mum and dad are great but there's one main rule: I must tell them were I go and what time I'll come back. Granny is the problem because she's a bit bossy! She usually tells me what to do and what kind of clothes I should wear but I don't care about it.###As you told me in your last letter, you were talking about rules in your class and you wanted to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home.

I went to the rock concert by U2 and to see the Chinese film "Chung King Express". Both of them were not only really enjoyable, but also reasonably-priced.

First of all, it would be greater if there were more famous people who have various nationalities. Because most of them were from English speaking country this year. In addition, larger halls should be provided for concerts since a lot of people could not get tickets for those by big stars. Moreover, personally, I hope that the number of plays and films will increase. I think they are the nearest 'arts' in real life.###First of all, it would be better if there were more famous people of various nationalities, because most of them were from English-speaking countries this year.

If you say that the wage is far from satisfaction, why don't you teach younger students as a private teacher. It's also a really popular job among university students because of the good salaly.

Firstly, the idea of holding this International Arts Festival is great. I made people enjoyed their weekend, relaxed themselves, and also it brought the foreign culture to them, enlarged their kownlegth. In addition to it, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £10, this was excellent, it made people only spend pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events at the weeked, for them it is a really economical way to spent their weekend. So my friends told me that this was his cheapest weekend.###Firstly, the idea of holding this International Arts Festival is great.

Moreover, the stars and artists were only from six countries, In my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more intesting, and from my point of view, some of the concert halls were too small, the people in there couldn't even go to the loo! because it was too crowed. Finally, the plays and films were wonderfully welcomed, as far as I'm concerned.

However, according to my notes, there are some doubt in the festival. While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world, they were from only six countries in fact. The number of plays and films were also very few. In addition to that some concert halls were too small for the audience to enjoy the concerts.###However, according to my notes, there are some doubts about the festival.

On balance, I feel that this annual festival can be even better next year. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you should collect artists and stars from more than six countries and rebuild larger concert halls. I also suggest that more plays and films should be taken. I would be grateful to support you providing that you would like to make the festival more successful.###On balance, I feel that this annual festival can be even better next year.

At school, the most horrible one is about the school uniform. I really hate it, because we're not allowed to wear casual and fashonable clothes, colourful shoes and colourful socks. We can't also turn our hair colour an have to keep our hair length above our eye blows. Next, we're not allowed to get driver licences which are for a motorbike and car as long as we've students. We're also not allowed to get part-time jobs. If possible, I want to change all of them.###At school, the most horrible one is about the school uniform.

However, at home I'm quite free. Just I can't go out after 9 o'clock in the night and I'm not allowed to play computer games for over two hours. These rules are not so strict that I can stand them.

First of all, the festival was a great idea. There were a number of stars and artists from around the world, but from only six countries. Secondly, they held some concerts, but some of the concert halls were so small that there was not enough space for all the people. Thirdly, it was nice to see several plays and films. We would be pleased if you could have more. Fourthly, everyone seems to have enjoyed seeing the dance shows and the art exhibitions and listening to the talks. Lastly, the weekend ticket was excellent because it was quite reasonable. However, a ticket for each event is expensive. I suggest you have a oneday ticket or a reasonable ticket for every event.###First of all, the festival was a great idea.

Speaking of rules, most of them are annoying! There're plenty of rules in my high school. For example, girls must keep the length of the skirt by 5 cm under their knees. That's so stupid! It doesn't bother studying, does it? And also we're not allowed to bring any sweets. I know some rules are necessary to control the students. The school uniform is a good example.

In my opinion some concert halls were too small. I could not listen to one of my favorite classic concert, "La Moldava" by Smetana. Most of the plays and films were brilliant but I think that if there is money enough, it will be better to have the possibility to watch more movies.###In my opinion some concert halls were too small.

In Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very stricht. Nobody has to be late in the morning because it is important to respect your class mades and teachers' effort of getting up early. Nobody is allowed to speak to a friend during the lesson. I can't have my mobile on and drinking and eating in the classroom is a bad beheviour. There isn't a kind of punishment for people who do these things.###In Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very strict.

At home, we must wash our hands before the lunch. And we mustn't speak during the lunch. I think it's not a good thing because we can't discuss  with our family.

Firstly I want to congratualate you for the festival. It was a great idea. However there were things that I didn't like. You said that stars and artists would come from around the world but there was only starts from six major countries. I suggest you to increase this number for the next year. By this way we can meet other stars and artists, see different cultures. Another thing that I will point on is, the concert halls are too small. Some people couldn't enter the hall and they missed the concerts. There were some plays and films. They were excellent so can you show more plays next year? The Last thing that I will say is "one reasonably-priced weekend ticket". It was a very good idea. I hope you will make the same thing next year.###Firstly I want to congratulate you on the festival.

I have a suprise for you. I will go to England this summer. May be we can meet there... You asked some questions about the rules in school and homes. Let me answer this question. In schools we aren't allowed to speak in classes. Also we must go to school by our uniforms. However we are allowed to eat, and drink during the breaks. All the time we must be kind to our friends and teachers. We mustn't forget the books for the classes. These are the rules in school. In our home there are some rules too! I must be in home untill 11pm. I am not allowed to listen to high volume music at home. I must be kind to my brother and my parents. When the guests come to our home, I must be clear. Other things are allowed to me. I want to change the school uniform rule so everybody can wear what they want. The Other rules are O.K. I want to hear some rules from you. Next time write the letter quick! I don't want to wait another 2 months.###I have a surprise for you. I come to England this summer. Maybe we can meet there...

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. After two days, the whole school knew. When Paul entered the school gate, other children began to tease him and laugh. Paul couldn't stand it. He ran out quickly, leaving everyone behind. He felt very ashamed and didn't know what to do. Normally, he would go and talk to Pat but Pat betrayed him. They were no longer friends. 'How could he,' Paul thought 'Now the whole school knows Jean attracts me'. As he was sitting there, he heard someone walking towards him. He turned around and saw... Jean. 'What are you dong here, why aren't you at school?' she asked. Paul was like paralyzed. He couldn't reply. 'I had heard what you've said about me', she said, I think it's sweet'. Paul couldn't believe his ears. While he was thinking how to reply, Jean took his hand and led him to the school. When they entered everyone became silent. All the children were staring at them and Paul thought that Pat isn't that bad at all.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. After two days, the whole school knew.

I saw Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were written on the advertisement paper and was very excited. However, Danny Brook did not appear on the stage until the end of musical showing time. I was really disappointed about it. Secondly, the starting time was 19:30 but it started 20:15 so I was waited for 45 minutes. It was so long time to wait in the theatre.###I saw Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were written on the advertisement paper and was very excited.

If the weather is hot then we don't have to wear under wear because very thin and light clothes will support our bodies. There will be two functions for summer clothes that we don't need to wear clothes like layer and layer. For example, T-shirts for women are included a bra: easy to take it out when you wash it, and it is very simple and comfortable. What about short pants? You don't have to wear knickers. We can just put some thin pads in there. We can't feel it and easy to remove and just can wash it.

I wouldn't like to be unkind but I must say that the advertisement for the show included a lot of false information.

I thought that if I said something specific about her he would look at her in a different way. Well, I forgot that it's just a boy! I shouldn't have told him that she was a virgin.

Firstly when I went to the show it was writing that the starting time was 19.30 but it started at quarter past eight. I had waitted for fourthey five minutes. Secondly the stars were going to be DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE but different people came to the show. It was the first time I was going to go to a musical show but I guess it will be the last one too.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Because last year I started smoking and nobody knew that I was smoking but one day as I was smoking at the back of the school some one came next to me and I noticed that it was Pat. She saw me as I was smoking so that wasn't going to be very good. She said that she wouldn't tell it to anyone but I knew she might say it to someone so I always was with her very minute, ever second. But one day as I was walking home like every night I saw Pat at the front of our house door talking to my dad. I just knew I couldn't have trusted to her but as I went in the house my dad offered pot to stay for a meal. I was in a schock, thinking why isn't anyone getting angry to me after a while we sat down for dinner and Pat just talk my parents that I was smoking and when my family heard they got ever so angry. I couldn't go out of the house for a month so now I know how Pat is and that she can't keep any secrets.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

Anyway we had a very disappointing evening. At first, we couldn't get any discount, although you mention it on your advertisment. And the only tickets left were at £20. Then the spectacle began 45 minutes later than mentioned. Last but not least, Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, whose name I probably forgot because of his poor performance. Afterwards we are used to eat at your restaurant which is not only well known for it's good price value but also for it's original decoration.###Anyway we had a very disappointing evening.

I drove to Ouchy where I took a drink. It was so hot, I decided to go for a swim in tutry, although I hadn't any swimming-clothes. I knew a good place. I parked the car and went ten minuts.

I walked back, hoping I wouldn't come accross anyone and be able to drive back home. The car was missing too.###I drove to Ouchy where I had a drink.

I went to your theatre last saturday, at about 7. p.m. I asked for discounts. But a clerk said that the time for discounts had been finished.

I felt nervous. When I saw an actor, he was a different actor. I was very upset and disappointed.###I went to your theatre last Saturday, at about 7. p.m. I asked for discounts.

I was in London for a week's holiday and I decided to go to the theatre. I saw your musical show advertised in my hotel and I decided to buy a ticket. I am still a student and I saw in the advertisment that there were some discounts available. I asked for it but the answer I received was that there wasn't any kind of discount. I arrived at the theatre at 19.00 and I thought I'd have waited only thirty minutes. I waited more than one hour because the show started at 20.15. But, at the moment, I thought that these things can happen. When the musical show started I had the third bad surprise. The male actor wasn't Danny Brook but an actor that I've never seen before. At the end of the show I was very hungry and so I had the brilliant idea to decide to go to the theatre restaurant but, of course, it was closed!###I was in London for a week's holiday and I decided to go to the theatre.

The male actor wasn't Danny Brook but an actor that I've never seen before. At the end of the show I was very hungry and so I had the brilliant idea to decide to go to the theatre restaurant but, of course, it was closed!

The first thing I do every day, when I get up, is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffe machine. Then I go to work by motorbike. The first thing I do when I arrive in my office is to switch on my computer. During all the day I speak with the majority of my collegues by telephone or e-mail. Sometime I stay alone all the day but I have contacts with many people.###The first thing I do every day, when I get up, is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffee machine.

When I have to book a holiday, to buy a book or to control my bank account I use the Internet and I do all these things, and many others, without moving from my office. When I finish to work I come back home. If I haven't enough time to cook I prepare my meal using my fantastic microwave hoven. If I'm too tired to go out with my friends I finish my day looking a programme on television. I know that it can appear a sad day but it's what a lot of people do every day in every part of the world.###When I have to book a holiday, to buy a book or to check my bank account I use the Internet and I do all these things, and many others, without moving from my office.

First of all, the advertisement I got layed emphasis on Danny Brook's starring in the show, but eventually, a disappoint, unknown actor played his part, and I wonder whether he had real skills to.###First of all, the advertisement I got laid emphasis on Danny Brook's starring in the show, but actually, a disappointing, unknown actor played his part, and I wonder whether he had real skills to.

Firstly, you spoke about two actors, Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but instead of them we had two others and they were really bad. So I was really surprised. In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late. It was boring for everybody.

Moreover, in your advert you spoke about discounts available but it was not the case. No discounts were available.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The nightmare started at this time. I though she was a really good friend but I made a mistake. She couldn't keep my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with. She didn't tell me yet but when I came in the class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well. I looked at her and she became pale and suddently left the class. I followed her and caught her to push her on the ground. I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me. I couldn't go back to the class so I went home. My Mum was at home and I told her all the story. She said that I had to be strong and didn't care about them. So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to stopped because he loved me and wanted to be with me. At this time all the girls became jealous and stopped to laugh.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The nightmare started at this time.

Early that day I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones, like the promotion paper said they made discounts to people that worked at the British Institute. I mentioned it, but they told me that the promotion had ended a long time ago. Why do you put it on the paper then? In the evening I got a flat tire, and because of this I got late to the show, when I got to my place, it was used (it cost a lot) and they took me to the cheapest seats, where I couldn't see a thing. After waiting a while in this uncomfortable place the show started, I waited 45 minutes and then the actors appeared, but I find myself that the main one wasn't Danny Brook, it was an impostor.###Early that day I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones, as the promotion paper said they gave discounts to people who worked at the British Institute.

Yesterday I decided to go to the "blue disco" because the guy I liked was going to be there.

There were a couple of things I noted down during the show. One of the reasons that I chose to see this show was to see Danny Brook live. But there was a different actor instead of him. I am very disappointed. Another problem that bothered me about the show was its late start. Instead of starting at 19:30 pm, it started at 20:15 pm. I had a meeting straight after the show but I was late and made a fool of my self by arriving late and had to suffer all those people starring at me and whispering. Then I found out that the discounts are not available but on the notice board, it said that they are available. After the show, I noticed that the theatre restaurant was closed because it was closed that day.###There were a couple of things I noted down during the show.

I'm writing to you to make a complaint on your advertisement, which I consider like a lying advertisement. Let me explain to you why I'm now so disappointed.

We are both very keen on musical shows. We've already attended "Cats", the "Phantom of the Opera", "les Miserables", "Grease", and so many others. When we saw your leaflet that mentionned "London's newest and best musical show", we were so enthusiastic and curious that we bought immediately the tickets. On the waiting evening, at the entrance stood people, who were shouting at you because there wasn't any discounts available. One thing that you promised on your leaflet. We didn't have trouble to find our seats, but we found it very annoying to have waited 45 minutes before the show goes on and more than that your famous actors weren't absolutely Mr Brook and Mrs Truelove and we can also add that your restaurant wasn't opened because of hygienic troubles. I can say now that "It wasn't my perfect evening out" and I request now some money back for all these disagreements.###We are both very keen on musicals.

Please find enclosed my thinking about the fashion of the future. First of all, I think we should consider the manner actually how the people are dressing to see how it's going to be developped into the future. Everyone has is own style but it's obvious that many of us is wearing the same clothes like others. We all follow the new collection on the market. Today it's wearing short-trousers and yesterday it was wearing broken-jeans. What we wear is also influenced by models, the medias, or new collection, which come from Paris, London, or New York. These new clothes are often very expensive, that's why maybe not everyone can afford to buy himself the newest clothes on the market. In 100 years, it's possible that each people will developp his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex, everything possible, in a way to create their own clothes.###Please find enclosed my thoughts about the fashion of the future.

Because, I think that people need to find again their authenticity.###In my opinion, I think that people will not wear clothes anymore, just be natural, being nude and feeling free, like many many years before.

Dear Sir/Madam; I am writing to complain about the musical show "Over The Rainbow", which as organised in your theatre. Firstly, I had been looking forward to that show since Danny Brook was to be one of the main actors; however, there was other actor instead of him, which came to me as a great disappointment. Secondly, as for the times of the performance, instead of 19.30 it all started at 20:15, which involved being stranded in the theatre for such a long time. Added to this, I had brought very little money in the hope that I would get a discount. Nevertheless, there was not any available. Finally, as regards the theatre restaurant, it was closed due to problems with the pipes. As you may realize, it was not a perfect evening out but a complete disaster. I am asking you for a full refund or at least part of my money back. I look forward to hearing from you, Yours faithfully ANDREHI LISA DANZELLI###Dear Sir/Madam; I am writing to complain about the musical show "Over The Rainbow", which was performed at your theatre.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. What is more, every time I trusted her with my secrets, she always let me down. It was always the same; she would meet with her neighbours afterwards and give my secrets away. To make matters worse, people gossiped about me and tried to find out more and more about my private affairs, which made me feel embarrassed. The worst point was that she started to make up false stories about me, which soon spread all around the neighbourhood.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

Needless to say, I couldn't put up with that situation any longer so I determined to fall out with her. Since then, I hasen't talked to her again, despite the fact that she regretted doing all that and really wanted to make up with me. Of course, I became aware of her feelings since a friend of mine overheard a conversation between Pat and other girl. In spite of that, I found it difficult to forgive her as she had hurt my feelings; that's why the only thing I could tell her since we had quarrelled was: "It serves you right, I'll hate you for the rest of your life!"###Needless to say, I couldn't put up with that situation any longer so I decided to fall out with her.

I am writing to you to complain about the musical show which took place the last 1st of May in "the Circle Theatre" in London. Your show was supposed to be one of the best that I had ever seen.

At home, for example, my waking up is no more a surrounding sound that breaks the silence and peace of my dreams, it is now the good-morning of my favourite radio program, set to start at seven o'clock.

What are going to look the clothes like in a century from now? Are they going to be the same, are they going to have colours, are men going to wear long skirts and women boxershorts?

Are they going to be the same, are they going to be colourful, are men going to wear long skirts and women boxer shorts? This is something that has troubled many people, especially those who work in the fashion industry.
Fashion has made a big progress since the ealary beggining of the world. The variety of new fabrics, their colours and quality,  make new fashions statements every day. Although the clothes are getting more and more smaller. In the early 90s it was in fashing for the women to wear only skirts. Long ones actually, and for men to wear trousers. In the sixties, people worn clothes with flowers, big glasses, and jeans, and men should have had long painted hair. Nowdays women were really short skirts, short t-shirts, short tops, and cut their hair short just like men. Boys pearce their bodys just like girls do. and the other way around. If this continues, the two lives will turn the one to the other and soon men will wear skirts. Clothes will get smaller (;practically people won't be wearing any clothes). People will were extreme. Clothes which will be really Lanky. People will wear all those clothes that expensive designers designe but nowone wears them.###Fashion has made a great progress since the early beginning. The variety of new fabrics, their colours and quality,  make new fashion statements every day. And the clothes are getting smaller and smaller. In the early 90s it was in fashion for the women to wear only skirts, long ones actually, and for men to wear trousers. In the sixties, people wore clothes with flowers, big glasses, and jeans, and men should have had long painted hair. Nowadays women wore really short skirts, short t-shirts, short tops, and cut their hair short just like men. Boys pierce their bodies just like girls do. and vice versa. If this continues, the two lives will turn the one to the other and soon men will wear skirts. Clothes will get smaller (;people will be wearing practically no clothes). People will wore extreme clothes which will be really lanky. People will wear all those clothes that expensive designers design but no one wears them.

 Firstly, in the advertisement you said that Dany Brook was going to be starring in the play, but you've placed another actor in his place, which was very disappointing. Moreover, the theatre's play was expected to start at half past seven in the afternoon, however it started at quarter past eight! We had to wait all that time without someone to explain to us the reason for this delay.### Firstly, in the advertisement you said that Dany Brook was going to be starring in the play, but put another actor in his place, which was very disappointing.

The biggest achievement of modern technology has broken into my house as soon as I was at the age of ten. This achievement is the personal computer, which has grown very fast, because of the help it can provide. My computer helps me in my studies, homeworks and projects for school. With the Internet, I got more socialised using the Relay Chat clients, but also got a kind of boredom, which is known as "Internet Freak Disease"! I use it a lot, so sometimes I feel pain in my eyes or my hands.###The biggest achievement of modern technology broke into my house as soon as I reached at the age of ten.

Dear Sir: I am writing to you this letter because I would like you to know about a musical show which I went to see to the Circle Theatre. First of all, I wanted to see this musical 'Over the Rainbow' because the actor Danny Brook was acting in it. But when the musical started I got very disappointed because Harry Smythe, a not very famous actor, was acting instead of Danny Brook. Then, the musical didn't start on time. It supposed to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour. All the people got very angry. Also I bought a £20 ticket because in the advertisement for the show was put that discounts were available for £10 £15, £20 tickets. I couldn't have my ticket discounted because when I went to buy it they told me that was untrue. Furthermore, in the advertisement was put that the theatre restaurant was opened but when we went there after the show, it was closed because the chief of the restaurant was ill. It was ridiculous! In conclusion, I didn't have my perfect evening out, in other words, I had a very disappointing evening so I am asking you for my money back. I would like to have my money back in ten days, in the other case, I would have to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

To begin with, I would like to inform you, in case you do not know, that the play does not start at 19.30 as it says in the advertisements.

On the other hand, despite the fact that you said that it was starring by Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, I must tell you that Danny Brook did not appear at all.

The last thing I would like to complain for is that the Theatre Restaurant was closed, because, as it said, of "VACATIONS". If in the advertisements and leaflets says "VISIT OUR THEATRE RESTAURANT AFTER THE SHOW" there are not reasons for it being closed. It should be opened at least until all people gets out of the place. It must be our decission whether to stay and eat there, or not.###The last thing I would like to complain about is that the Theatre Restaurant was closed, because, as we were told, of "VACATIONS".

To make it shorter, because of everything I have said before, the correct thing to do for me is to ask for my money back, and for you it is just giving it back to me because of all the troubles and disappointings feeling you made me suffer.

HOW HAS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR DAYLY LIFES?###HOW HAS TECHNOLOGY CHANGED OUR DAILY LIVES?
In times of our grandparents life was so different, that we cannot beleive that this huge change to our day life happened in only one hundred years or less.###In our grandparents' time life was so different, that we cannot believe that this huge change to our daily life happened in only one hundred years or less.
First, we have to admit that technology has really increased the access to communication, traveling and geting information. You can now know what happens on the other side of the world, at the same time as it is happening. What is more, you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the "enter" key in a computer.###First, we have to admit that technology has really increased our ability to communicate, travelling and getting information.

Furthermore, as we all know, day life now a days is quite simplier and an example of this is that instead of buying a peice of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and cooler. Strange as it seems, we now can have every types of machine or especialized technology to make our dayly life more confortable and less workable. Things that human beings used to do, now are being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly.###Furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.

Things that human beings used to do, are now being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly.
One the other hand, despite the fact that technology make things easier in our day life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people. As people do not get a job because they is not needed they get into poorness, criminal activities, being isolated and without the possibility of getting a good education. This is the most terribly disadvantage technology has.###On the other hand, despite the fact that technology makes things easier in our daily life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people.

With advantages and disadvantages, technology is in our life and may represent an advance for some and a bad thing for others.

Dear Sir, I would like to show you how disappointed I am about the musical show you manage. As I had a whole week holiday I decided to spend it in London. At first I though I would just make a bit of sight-seeking all around the city. But when one night I saw your advertisement I decided to spend my last night in the city watching a musical show. No sooner had I seen who the starring actor was than I couldn't believe it. Danny Brook was one of my best friends while I was at University. But as the show began, I realised that the actor was someone different, his name was Tim Paradise. If this had been my only disappointment nothing would have happened, but I had to wait stil quarter past eight in order to watch the show, instead of it beggining at half past seven as you had written in your advertisement.###Dear Sir, I would like to tell you how disappointed I am about the musical show you manage.

One day as I was talking with my teacher about the project I saw what it could be the final answer sheet to the exam on the top of his desk. Suddenly, when the teacher went out of his office, I quickly copied the answers on my notebook, I couldn't believe it, that would be the easiest exam I would had ever done. As I went out of the office I found walking down the corridor Pat, my best friend. As she was also making the project I decided to let her copy the answers. I told her she hadn't to talk about that to anybody. She agreed and went home very happy. When night came I couldn't believe what was happening. Almost all my class mates were in the front door of my house asking me if I had the solutions of the exam. I couldn't believe that my best friend had told everybody about my secret.###One day as I was talking with my teacher about the project I saw what it could be the final answer sheet to the exam on the top of his desk.

Firstly, it's written that in it will be played by Danny Brook, but in fact it wasn't. I was very disappointed when I saw someone I've never heard about it. In addition to this, the timetable, 19.30, wasn't correct.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is my best friend. We spent all our childhood together, usually driving our parents mad. As we grown up, we were getting closer and closer, sharing all our love stories and even more. I'm certain, that our friendship is stronger than other people. But I do have a problem with her. Pat isn't good at keeping secrets. Even worth, she is not able to keep anything to herself. For instance, I was organizing a party for my sister's birthday, asking all her. friends to keep to close their mouths. All did except one: Pat. Last year, Pat and I were driving back home and unfortunately, driving too fast, I drove through the front gate. I was wondering how to tell my parents and I asked Pat if she could keep it secret till I found the way to tell them. Of course, the following day all my family had heard about my odd story. In conclusion to this, why do I still go on with her, it's the fact I love her as well as my sister and I know that she can change it if she would because, last week, she organized a huge party for me, without telling me.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

I could bare it by the time. Moreover, the show was awful. I like Danny Brook and Tina Truelove's acting but he actors were changed without mentioning, also the restaurant was closed by the excuse that it was to be repaired. In fact, the notice had been showed since last winter. It means that the theatre have not made any efforts for the people.###I could bare it by the time. Moreover, the show was awful.

For example, the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor, but he was not. Instead, there was this unknown actor with a very bad performance and had a terribly annoying voice. Moreover, the play did not start at the time it was supposed to. I had to wait for forty five minutes. All the waiting made me quite hungry, so I was expecting to have good meal at the theatre restaurant after the show. However, it was closed for cleaning.###For example, the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor, but he was not.

I had a week's holiday in London last week, when I saw your advertisement concerning the 'Over the Rainbow' musical show. The advertisement looked pretty interesting and I dicided to go to the theatre to watch this musical show. Especialy due to the fact that I wanted to see Danny Brook - my favourite actor. I was really disappointed when I saw a different actor. The 'theatre' even did not appologize for this range. To make things worse the show started 45 minutes later than it should have been (it started at 20:15 instead of 19:30). Despite I am a student and the advertisement said that discounts were available, I was refused to buy a half-a-price ticket, and the explaination 'why' wasn't sufficiant. I tried to relax after the show, so I made my way to the theatre restaurant, which, according to the advertisement, ought to be open at that time. Unfortunately it was not, which made me even angier. There was no information about why it was closed and if it would be open at all.###I had a week's holiday in London last week, when I saw your advertisement concerning the 'Over the Rainbow' musical show.

First of all, as you can see Starring was Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on your advertisement but when I sat in my seat, a different actor and actress appeared.

First of all, the developed technology and science will make our life more convenient than now. All your stuffs will be performed by the computers.

Fashion are always changing therefore it is really difficult to say what sort of clothes people wear in the future.

However, I think the style of fashion will not have big differences because I believe that fashion is in a circle. The mean of this is all our fashion styles come from history.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was a very pretty and kind girl, but she had this bad habit. This was her only fault. She had a lot of friends but nobody trusted her. That was why she decide to change her behaviour. She was given a chance: if she had been able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time, her friends would have started trusting her. The secret was about a surprise-party for her bestfriend's birthday. As soon as the arrangement for the party started, she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her bestfriend. But, as the days went by, she was surprised because she realized she was getting used not to tell secrets any more. The day of the party arrived and Pat succeeded in keeping the secret. All her friends were amazed at how she had her change and started trusting her at once.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

The first thing that dissapoint me was the starring. I expected to see Danny Brook because at the paper that you have given to me it wrote that Danny Brook came but there was a different actor. Then you wrote that it start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15. You wrote that discounts were available but they are not available. You wrote that "visit our restaurant after the show" so I didn't eat my supper, to eat at your restaurant. but the reastaurant was closed because the show started at 20:15 and finissed at 00.15 and the restaurant was opened until 00.00. Finally you wrote that it would be "your perfect evening out" but after all this problems how would you expect the to have a perfect evening out.###The first thing that disappoint me was the star.

Science and technology characterize our moder society. They have taken a big progress in our every day life and they have always become more important for us. If you think that fifty years ago, when there weren't cars or any sort of comfort (born just in the "industrial age") everything had to be done by hands or by animal work: I think in that time life was really much harder than now! We have to say that technological searches have taken in our society "their good fruits" but, at the same time, they have negative aspects too. Walking on a city street, it's difficult to find parks or "green" places with trees and clean air: actually pollution, traffic and noize are the main problems of our society. I know I'm a "daughter of this techological world" and unluckly I think I could'n stay without it: it's rather strange that today there's already somebody without a phone, dishwasher, TV... But, sometimes I ask myself if the "ancient world", without science, technological discoveries and industries was more authentic than the our one.###Science and technology characterize our modern society.

According to your advertisement, the actor should be Danny Brook, but infact it was a different person. My ticket was for 19.30, but it started very late, it started at 20:15. When the show finished, it was too late to catch the train to home. I had to take a taxi. It costed me £30. "What a waste!,, By the way, I didn't see any discounts for buying tickets. One more thing, the theatre restaurant was closed when I get there for a glass of drink, I don't know why, there was no written notes or information about that.

Last week, I missed work on Tuesday, so Pat had to work harder because she was all alone. I appreciated her and she wouldn't mind. I told her the reason that I had to miss the work. My son was in prison. I had to go and see him. I still don't know how it really happens to him. All I know is it is about drug smuggling, and that he is involved. I asked to her not to tell anyone, because I didn't want others know about this.

Danny Brook is my favorit actor & to see him was my dream from my childhood! It was a suprise when we were told there will be another actor. Also, we expected to get a discounts as a students, but international students cards are not available in your theater (that is very strange - even your advertisment has an information about discounts). Another problem - we were very hungry that evening because the show was postpone for 45 minutes! so we were late to our supper in the hotel and the theatre restaurant was also closed without any risons given.###Danny Brook is my favourite actor & to see him was my dream since my childhood!

So on Saturday, June 7, I was there for the 7:30 pm show and here are my reasons for complaining. Firstly, there were no discounts available such as those stated in your advertisement, not even for students, and I had to pay for a full-price ticket.

No need to say how much I was disappointed to see that another actor was performing instead of Danny Brook and the actor didn't seem to have rehearsed the role very much. At the end of the show, I decided to have dinner in your theatre restaurant and I went there ...just to find out that it was closed because it was being newly painted.###No need to say how much I was disappointed to see that another actor was performing instead of Danny Brook and the actor didn't seem to have rehearsed the role very much.

To sum up, it was not the "perfect evening out!" you advertised. So I am asking you to pay me back at least half of the ticket price for the inconvenience that was caused to me. I hope that you will understand my request and reply to me in a positive way by sending me a cheque to my address in France (see the letterhead).###To sum up, it was not the "perfect evening out!" you advertised.

At that time, I used to buy a lotery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts. One day, while I was checking my weekly ticket, I found out that I had five numbers out of six so that I would surely get a substancial amount of money.###At that time, I used to buy a lottery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts.

But soon everyone in the class was looking at me smillingly and I find out that I had many unsuspected friends... No longer after, they were asking me to pay a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed to go shopping, others to go to the cinema and the restaurant.

Endly came the end of the week and I went to the lotery office to check the amount I had won.

And regarding the Times; the show had to start at 19:30, however it started at 20:15. Therefore, people there had to wait for 45 minutes. Also, there was said there to be discounts for the ticket but I saw nothing like this. All the people there gave the same amount of money. After the show, I went to the restaurant in the theatre to eat something but it was closed because it was being cleaned that day.###And regarding the times, the show was meant to start at 19:30, however it started at 20:15.

I was very disappointed. In addition the concert didn't start on time. It was a quarter of an hour late. If I knew that the show was going to be late, I would ask my mom to come with me, because her working hour ended at eight o'clock. The restaurant was closed after the show ended. On the other hand there were no discounts available, as a result I had to paid extra money for the tickets.###I was very disappointed. In addition the concert didn't start on time.

'She was my best friend, how can she do it to me?' - - I was crying. When I was walking through the forest I saw a very tall man who was staying in front of me. 'My name is Jon' - he whispered - 'Don't be afraid'. We started to talk. This alien was so intelligent and funny that I forgot about my troubles. We talked for all night and I fall in love with him.

I made a beautifull invite cards for every Agatha friends with a sign: "Do not tell Agatha about that, this is a suprise party for her, please keep the secret!" Pat arranged a great DJ and drinks. My friend and I made a perfect decoration with ballons and other party stuff. Everyone told us it was breath taking. Everything was set... the day and hour came. Everyone gared in the disco at 21.00. We were only waiting for Agatha, who should come at 22 o'clock with her boyfriend. It was so exaiting!!! We put off the lights and then the door opened and I just heard "What the hell is going on?!!" She entered the room, and everyone shouted HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR! She was so touched that we started to cry. Enyway the disco was great, music also. We had fun to 5 o'clock!

I thought that I would have a great time there, but I was really disappointed in that evening. You said there would be stars such as Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, whose music is my favourate, but the musicians were actually some other people whose names I had never heard of. In the advertisement of the show, you said it would begin at 19.30, actually it was 45 minutes delay. The discounts of tickets that you mentioned were not exist. It could make things worse that the visit to your theatre restaurant, which had already been closed because of a lack of customers, was canceled.

However, all my expectations failed to become true. First of all, I found that no discounts for tickets were available. Although you mentioned it in your advertisement. Next, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. And, finally, right before the starting they announced that Danny Brook woud not be in the show that evening. So he was replaced by another actor.

Among the greatest inventions of man I came accross dayly are the telephone, computer and automobile. At any time of a day I may contact any person at any part of the world over the phone.

Computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get an access to huge informatonal sources through the internet, to make shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly.

It caused me missed the train and I went back to the hotel when it was nearly in the mid-night. Another problem is, I realised that the discounts were available. However, there wasn't any discount. Additionally, the advertisement said I can visit the threatre restaurant after the show. When I arrived, it was closed. That is so annoying that everything had been changed without any notice.###Firstly, there was a different actor instead of the famous actor, Danny Brook. That left me so disappointed.

It was a very long time since I was in Year 7. I told Pat that my far and mother were going to seperate. I told her because I wanted somebody to share my feeling. May be it was a wrong decision to tell her, she began to spread that secrect to everybody, including the teachers. They tried to contact with my parents. My parents were very angry when they realised what happened. All my friends were trying to kept air distance with me. That was all because of Pat.###It is a very long time since I was in Year 7.

First of all, when I paid my entrance fee they didn't acept me my discount ticket, they said me that the ticket was false, then I enter to the theatre and I had to wait 45 min, the show was suposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15, "this is a lack of respect".###First of all, when I paid my entrance fee they didn't accept me my discount ticket, they told me that the ticket was fake, then I entered to the theatre and I had to wait 45 minutes.

When the show started the starring was wrong because it said that act Danny Brook and Tina Truelove appeared and Danny Brook did'n act, it was another actor that nobody knew, "Really this is very disappointing". After the show I planned to go to the restaurant with my wife, but what do you think it happened?

Dear manager I am writing to you because of your new musical show "Over The Rainbow''. I have spent my holiday in London recently and, it is like a tradition, we went to a musical. After reading your programme I was very impressed and I was looking forward to see it. But firstly when we bought our tickets, we didn't get any discount, we had to pay the full price. And then the show started at 20:15 p.m., although it was supposed to start at 19:30 p.m., so we've had to wait quite long in this crowded room. And when the show finally started, I realized that it was not Danny Brook acting, instead there was an unknown, not very talented actor. After the show we wanted to go to your theatre restaurant, because we were very hungry, but then we saw that it was closed, because of staff illness. I would like to ask you to give us our money back, because it has been a very disappointing evening for us. Yours sincerely, Sara Schmidt###Dear manager I am writing to you because of your new musical show "Over The Rainbow''.

Two weeks before his birthday he started asking us what we were gong to do. That annoyed us so much, that we started making something up.

We can hardly imagine life without compures, T.V. sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet, none of these things existed seventy years ago. I think that the life we live is easier than the life our parents lived, thanks to technology. We can do things our grandparents could only dream of. The Internet, I think, is one of the most important inventions in the history of humanity. My life has not been affected or changed by technology, because when I was born, most of the things that I use in my daily life already existed. But technology is becoming more and more complicated, and new things are invented every day, so I think that our life will be completely different in forty years. And, since all these new things only make our life easier, technology is welcome.###We can hardly imagine life without computers, TV sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet, none of these things existed seventy years ago.

There was no Danny Brook but instead of him there was a different actor and I'm very dissapointed about it because I'm his fan.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But when I came to this school a few months ago I didn't know this. We are in the same maths set so I met him rather soon.

Her name was Marine. I saw her as a perfect girl with who I fallen in love with. So one day she offered to me to come to her house at night and to do so I had to run away from our boarding house and that was illigal. I had decided to go. So I woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning and climed out of the window. Unfortunately for me Pat at the time went to the toilet and saw me. So I asked him to keep it in secret.

What is worse, the ticket price was not reduced despite the fact that I showed my student ID. Visiting your theatre should have been the most pleasant time during my holiday in London. I do hope you will understand my feelings and send some money back.###First, I expected to see Danny Brook but a different actor appeared without any explanation being given.

It was just an usual day. Somehow I felt like sharing my secret with her and told her that the new pop singer who was very popular among girls was my cousin. Pat was very surprised but soon she began asking me lots of questions about him. I didn't mind telling her about my cousin, actually he isn't different from other boys at all, he just has sweet-looking. Next day, I went to school as usual and got agog at a large number of girls waiting for me around my rocker. They all seemed to want to be my best friend, and only Pat seemed to be happy to be my best friend.###It was just an ordinary day.

On day we decided to write a special letter to Pat; in the letter we told him that we felt in love, we were a beautiful girl with long hair and green eyes (as Pat likes women).

Poor Pat, he was so happy because a girl loves him and so nervous at the same time, even eating his nails. As I said at the beginning Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so he told us that he had a love letter but we couldn't read it. Three days after we sent him another letter, and Pat told us again but we said, "oh Pat, don't tell us that lie again", so Pat got furious and showed us the letter. We laughed and explained to him that we were the ones who wrote that letters, and made him promises that when he gets a secret lover, a real one, he don't tell anyone because if he does he won't meet her.###Poor Pat, he was so happy because a girl loved him and so nervous at the same time, even biting his nails.

It is certainly true that the modern technology has been changing our life a lot in these days. But how does it affect to my daily life? I get up in the morning with the soft sound of a radio program, not the sound of an alarm clock and eat my breakfast watching TV news. In the bus or even in the tube, I can talk with a friend with a mobile phone when I feel boaring. Sometimes I even do some games with it. In accordance with study or work, I use a internet, which is the easist way to get informations from all around the world. Furthermore, I can write a letter to my friend who is abroad in such a short time. Without it, it would take more than one week. After comming home, I can make myself relaxed with the smooth sound of classical music from the Hi-Fi. In conclusion, modern technology affects a lot to my daily life as well as the whole society. And in my opinion the amount of it's affection to the human life would be more than this in the future.###It is certainly true that the modern technology has been changing our life a lot in these days.

According to your advertisement, Danny Brook was involved in the show, but to my disappointment there was a different actor. To make things worse, the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Besides, there was a problem with tickets. According to the advertisement, discounts were available, but in reality it wasn't so! On top of everything, when I decided to visit your theatre restaurant after the show, it turned out to be closed. When I insisted on the explanation of this fact, I was told that the chief cook was on holiday!###According to your advertisement, Danny Brook was involved in the show, but to my disappointment there was a different actor.

My sister's birthday was coming. Her friends and I decided to present her with the thing she had been dreaming of for a long time - a puppy. We knew it would be a great present and she would be extremely happy. But the most important thing was that it would be really surprising to her, because she could hardly ever think of such a present.###My sister's birthday was coming.

We bought a beautiful puppy and were waiting for the holiday probably even more impatiently, than Susie. But unfortunately Pat didn't manage to keep our secret. He told her about the present as soon as he saw her. I'm sure he did it not because he wanted to spoil everything, but because he was so happy and excited, that he couldn't act in a different way. Susie liked the puppy very much, her eyes were shining, but her friends were a little bit sad and disappointed, because they were expecting a completely different ending.###We bought a beautiful puppy and were waiting for the party probably even more impatiently, than Susie.

Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, as written in the advertisement, but his part was played by another actor, without any information or excuse being given from the direction. Secondly, I coudn't get a discount with my student card and the show started 45 minutes later. In addition, the theatre restaurant, where we had planned to eat, was closed because the cook was ill.###Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, as written in the advertisement, but his part was played by another actor, without any information or explanation being given by the management.

Maybe you could explain to me, what the problems were. By problems I mean, that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why there were no discounts avaivable? But these are only little problems. The most disappointing thing was that there were diffrent actors to those advertised which were not very good in acting. And after the show we didn't know what to do with the rest of the evening, because we actually wanted to go to the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was closed.###Maybe you could explain to me, what the problems were.

Unfortunately, modern technology made the life for many people easier. If you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and noone had an opertunity to fly to another country for a holiday, people had to walk or go by horse and ship. Today, everyone has the opertunity to just get into a car and drive to where ever they want to. Modern technology also allows you to go into the Internet to get any information you need. Every production is much faster and cheaper than before, because you don't have to pay for the worker anymore. Every thing is controlled and produced by machines. This also is a very big disatvantage because many people are losing thier jobs. The only and simple advantage of modern technology is just taking the work from us so we don't have to do anything anymore. Another disadvantage is that every one becomes a bit more lonely because they wath TV or play or work with the Computer and don't see each other any more because they don't have to. You never get bored.###Unfortunately, modern technology has made the life for many people easier.

When it finally started I noticed that the famous actor Danny Brook was replaced by someone who was not as good as him. Danny Brook was the reason that most people came to see the show. After some time, a few of them started to leave the theatre. I was a little more portient so I stayed to watch the hole show, which by the way was the worst I had ever seen. I don't know why I payed £20 with no discounts, as the advertisements said it woul have. Then I thougt that I should go to the theatre restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that I couldn't say that I wasted my time by coming here.

The last ten year computers had entered almost every house, especially in rich countrys. Competers entirely changed people lives. Children can play games on it or watch a film.

I have to admit that it was not as I expected; First of all, the main reason I went to see "Over the Rainbow" was its actor, Danny Brook. It was very disappointing when I realised he wasn't in the scene. Beside this, I had to wait three quarters of an hour before the show started. During this time, I decided to have a drink in the restaurant but, as well as being closed, there was no nobody from the staff that could help me. I couldn't believe it! I would never have imagined this could happen in such a well-known theatre. Furthermore, you talk about discounts in your leaflets and they were no available, so, it was an expensive evening!###I have to admit that it was not as I expected; First of all, the main reason I went to see "Over the Rainbow" was its actor, Danny Brook.

I won't never forget the day the doctor told me and my Mum the thruth of my strange disease. He just said there weren't resources to face it at that moment but... I bursted into teas as well as my Mother. It seemed the end of something lovely, step by step. I got conscious of my problem and despite being a personal matter I decided to tell it to Pat.

First of all, the performers should be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. However, there were two unknown actors in the show. I feel most disappointed about this. The show was started at 20.15 but actually it should have started at 19.30. Moreover, I bought a £20 ticket without any discount even the advertisement mentioned that a discount is available. And after the show, we went to visit the theatre restaurant. Unfortunately, it was closed because at that day was their day-off.

Actually, we were quite good friends before the event happened. Pat has been studying in the same class with me since this year. She is sitting next to me, we started to chat more and more, then we became good friends. One day, we were sitting in the dinning-hall like usually. Suddenly my heart was thumbing so quickly because I saw him? - A boy who is a new student. I know this is one right love, I'm absolutely besorrted of him. Then I told this to Pat and told her to keep it secret: I didn't want people gossip behind me then everyone would know I fancy him. But the thing which I've never expected is Pat betrayed me. She told everyone that I fancy him and everybody always make a joke on it, that makes me feel so embarrised: I was very angry at that time!###Actually, we were quite good friends before this event happened.

First of all, using a computer is the most important thing for me because I can store my personal records such as diary or expenses and I send E-mail to my friends who live abroad. I used to write letters but it takes time to arrive there or sometimes disappear, so E-mail is brilliant for my life. In addition to this, doing the internet is quite useful and helpful to have information from all over the world. Before I go on holiday I use the internet to book or get details from the travel agency, which means I could save my time and physical energy. In conclusion, in my opinion, there are many advantages in my daily life at present and I would recommend people learn computers and would like to say "Enjoy your lives".###First of all, using a computer is the most important thing for me because I can store my personal records such as diary or expenses and I send E-mail to my friends who live abroad.

According to the advertisement, Danny Brook would be starring in the show but it was a different actor. It was really disappointing! Furthermore, the show started at the wrong time.

On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks. First and foremost is the pollution and big cities are suffering with it. It can cause lots of problems to our health.

First of all, in your advertisement you refer to discounts that are available, but, when we bought our tickets, one of the employees refused to give us 'tickets student price'.

In addition to this, it was not the famous actors that you have mentionned in the advertisement performing, so we were disappointed.###First of all, in your advertisement you refer to discounts that are available, but, when we bought our tickets, one of the employees refused to give us 'student price tickets'.

Let's have a look at different points. From the past until now, we have been wearing several different types of fashionable clothes, but why?

In addition to this, anyone will agree with me that clothes are the best invention ever. Furthermore, it's one of the best way to make money.###Let's have a look at different points.

First of all, I think we have grown up with the technology. It's difficult for us to realize the changes in our live, but we can think about it. How has it change my daily life? Well, in one word it made my life comfortabler. Now I only used to push a button, and things or mashines work on their own. Homework is easer to find in the cumputer than in a book sometimes. Everything is faster, and sometimes technology go so fast that I'm unable to follow it.

On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine. We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical "Over the Rainbow" in the "Circle Theater". We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets, but, when we arrived, a long line of people were standing there, waiting to get tickets. After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the points because, I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't play! So when the miserable musical came to his end, we were happy to leave the theater room, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no restaurantes were opened anymore, because it started too late. So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just found a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a short sign on a door: "Sorry, we are closed because of renovations"! We thought it would be a joke, but it wasn't. Because you are the manager, I think you are the only person who can change something. I would prefer getting my money back, instead of taking a lawyer. I will never visit your theatre again!###On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And we knew that from the day on, that if he knows anything about our secret we will live in danger of being caught. We, that were Tim, Gudrun, Paul and me, Hedwiga, had founded our own mafia, we were the kings in our small town, and we had a lot of people paying us money, so that we won't attack them. We had this idea first, when we watched a movie about the Italian mafia in an English lesson in school. It was love of first slight and we were fascinated by the thought, of building a kind of the same organisation in our town. Pat was my big brother, who had heaed of some people paying, "safty-money", but never know the reason, until he found a big amout of money in my room. His thoughts combined and ready to go to the police he went out of our house, where me and my homies were just hanging aroud. He saw me and tolled me into my face you are a thief and a burglar and I will go now to the police, I didn't know what to do ,but then I had an idea.... Yeah fokes, that was the point I got interupted by my parents in this beautiful dream, but when you will hear the end of my story than buy the "Rossall-School-magazin", net time again, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

How much effort and time it took about two decades go to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat, and modern coffee machines can make even a cappuccino or whatever you want on their own. Those devices made our life easier like old fridges had to be defreezed to melt out and new fridges use a different kind of cooling system and will tell you if your forgot to close the door! The modern cooker will turn off itself if something goes wrong! Personally, my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to the devices modern technology offers us.###How much effort and time it took about two decades ago to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat, and modern coffee machines can even make a cappuccino or whatever you want on their own. Those devices have made our life easier as old fridges had to be defrosted and new fridges use a different kind of cooling system and will tell you if you have forgotten to close the door!

First you have written that the starring were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but the real actors were different. It was a disappointing for me, because this actors were recommended by my friend, because he knows Danny and Tina.###First you have written that the stars were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but the actual actors were different.

You have also written in your advertisement that it would started at half past seven but it started at 20:15! So we had to wait more than a half hour. It wouldn't be mind if the restaurant had pressed in order to eat or drink something, but it was closed, and it hadn't also opened after the show, because the waitress had to clean up the theatre room.###You have also written in your advertisement that it would start at half past seven but it started at 20:15!

I had been looking forward to see my favorite actor Danny Brook, but he had been replaced by some other actor. I was not too happy about that and why didn't the theatre start when it was suposed to start? (45 min late), and where were the discounts which were supposed to be available? Your advertisement was ful of false advertising. In the end of the show I was looking forward to have a nice dinner in the restaurant together with my boyfriend, but it was closed, because you were short of staff. This was not my perfect evening out. I want to have at least half of my money back. I hope you preciate my letter and that you'll try to improve the disadvantages./ Sally Svenssen###I had been looking forward to seeing my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he had been replaced by some other actor.

The Manager of the Theatre Dear Sir, I am writing to you so as to express my great disappointment about the Musical Show "Over the Rainbow," which I attended to, a fortnight ago. To begin with, never have I been so upset as when I realized that the I expected famous actor, Danny Brook, did not show up at the performance and that he had been shamefully replaced by an unknown actor whose performance was, quite mediocre. Your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracy; this entertainment did not sart at 19.30 p.m but only at 20.15. More over, I was looking forward to getting a reduction on the pricing of the ticket as, indicated on your adverts, but I, once again, fell flat. Indeed, it so happened that this was not the case at all. Additionally, I could not even enjoy having a drink, after the show, in the Theatre Restaurant as it was simply closed for renovation. "A Perfect evening out"!? Not at all. Under these circumstances, as your Theatre did not fullfil its commitments, I ask you for a full refund and I expect to receive a cheque of £15, as soon as possible Yours faithfully###The Manager of the Theatre Dear Sir, I am writing to you so as to express my great disappointment about the Musical Show "Over the Rainbow," which I attended to, a fortnight ago.

A couple of weeks later, my sister called me as I was at work; completely devastated and weaping scalding tears, she could, hardly pronounce a word.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Last Wednesday Carole received a letter. The stamp was from a foreign country and the address was written in Capital Letters. She didn't recognize the writing. She began to read, "Dear Carolin.." There was only a person who used to call her by this name. It brought a lot of memories back to her. It was long time ago, when she was fourteen and Paul sixteen. He was her first love and also the first who kissed her. Paul had to move to Mexico because of his father's work. When they were saying goodbye Paul said, "I will be the last person who will kiss you". "It sounds nice but I don't believe it," she replied. "You only have to wait," he said. But she didn't wait. She got married and had two children. At this moment Carole was living with her husband but they didn't love each other any more. Their love had finished.

First of all, there was another actor instead of Danny Brook (as it was written in the advertisement).

No discounts were given and, what is more, your theatre restaurant was closed all the time. I was not able to have a dinner after the show.

Three hundred years ago fashion changed up one time in each hundred years. One hundred years ago it was one time in 50-25 years.

Fashion is becoming more useful, all the new inventions and technologies are going to play an important part in the fashion industry of the future.###Three hundred years ago fashion changed once every hundred years.

It is very difficult to predict but let us try to imagine what will clothes be like 100 years from now. With no doubt, the influence of modern technologies will be great. Future clothes will be very useful and incredibly comfortable, we can see the progress in the fashion even now. It seems that the decorative role of clothes will have disappeared by the year of 2050.###It is very difficult to predict but let us try to imagine what clothes will be like 100 years from now.

I saw your advertisement and I expected a discounted ticket for students. But in a ticket office I realised I couldn't get it. Another problem was the time. The play was supposed to start at 19.30 but it was delayed, so at 20.15 a curtain of the stage was pulled up. As soon as the play had started I noticed another problem. I am a big fan of Danny Book and it was why I chose 'over the rainbow'.

First it helps to make my social life to be convinient. I have got my own computer so it is easy for me to send e-mails to my friends very often. Second, I can save time.

On the other hand, modern technology could affect my life in a bad way. Because of computeres or telephones I could have less chances to meet my friends than before. It could make my emotions fade. Another problem is pollution. I think a car is one of the most common products of modern technology. The more cars there are on the street, the more difficult it is for me to keep myself fit.###On the other hand, modern technology could affect my life in a bad way.

Circle theatre's Manager: I am writting to you because I felt dissapointed after seeing the musical show "Over the Rainbow". There were many things that were wrong in the advertisement I saw. First the actors who were suppoused to star in this show were not the ones put in there. So when I saw the show I felt horrible, because I was expecting to see Danny Brook. But the problems started while I arrived at the place. I had a discount for it, but they refussed it and I had to pay the full price. Appart from this, the show started fourty five minutes later. I think this reasons are suficiently enough to ask for my money back. So I hope that you will understand my point. Please be comprehensive and realize that your show was not cheap. I'm a student, so I do not have a lot of money and I need it back. I also had to tell you that the theatre restaurant was closed because there were too few people there and they take me out of the place, so I was very upset. I will go to your office this week. I hope to see you there.###Circle theatre's Manager: I am writing to you because I felt disappointed after seeing the musical show "Over the Rainbow".

There are some differences between the advertisement and the real show.

To make it worse, neither discounts or restraurants were available at that night although they were said to be available. According to the owener of the restaurant, it was closed because the plugs of some lights were cut off.###There are some differences between the advertisement and the real show.

There have been already a variety of fashion style nowadays. Some are in formal others are in casual.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She told our parents that we were going to get married in Brazil. Because of this, Sally's parents and my parents went to Brazil rapidly. Sally and I had bought a nice big house beside the sea in the outskirts of the city. It had three bedrooms, two bathrooms, one dining room and one kitchen. Indeed, it had a big swimming pool and a beatiful garden. When my parents arrived in Brazil and found us, our dreams were erased. We had to come back to Spain. Because of this, we had to sell the house and left our jobs. When we arrived in Spain, we had to explain to our parents all about our adventure.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

It is rare the schools that don't have a multimedia centre with many computers to the students use. But it is good and bad in the same time.

The main problem was that Danny Brook did not take part in the show. However, I bought a £20 ticket mostly because I saw his name in the advertisement. Furthermore, the show started only at 20:15, although, it had to start at 19:30. Moreover your theatre restaurant was closed all evening, and I think you should know that ticket were sold without any discounts.###The main problem was that Danny Brook did not take part in the show.

In my own personal experience, technology is something I can't live without. From a simple domestic appliance, a TV or a radio, to a cell phone or a computer, my life is much better now than it was before. For example, whenever I go out by myself, my father gives me a cell phone, to call him in case I need anything. Another thing I depend on is the computer. Not only to play games or use the Internet, but also to write my papers for school.###In my own personal experience, technology is something I can't live without.

First it was because of the culture difference. It took quite a long time to adjust in the multi culture in the language institue. Secondly the language ability was another issue.

For the attention to the manager: I am writing to complain about the organization of the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented. Firstly, it was said that the stars who were invited to the estatement were Dany Brook and Tina Truelove. However, Dany Brook did not act and was replaced by another actor who was terribly disappointing on his performance. In addition, the event was supposed to start at 19.30 but we could not enjoy the show until 20.15. The advertisement for the show announced that we would were able to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to the Chef who leaded the Restaurant did not remember to bring the keys to open it. Also, the advertisement said that discounts for the tickets would be available, but it was not. To conclude, I would be grateful if the organization of the theatre bring me my money back. yours sincerely,###For the attention of the manager: I am writing to complain about the organization of the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented.

We invited him to enjoy the concert of Texas but he started to make nonsenses because of the drugs.

The show should have started at half past 7 pm but nothing happened. I waited and it becomes 8 o'clock pm - nothing happened. At quarter past 8 pm the show started and I was looking for Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. But I saw some foreign actors I didn't know. I was very wrong and afraid about it and I remember that this was the third problem this evening. By arriving at the theatre there were no discounts available. Now I asked myself if there will come another problem. The problem came.

I am writing this letter I in order to complain about my unpleasant experience in your theatre. Two days ago, I went to see the musical show "over the rainbow" at your theatre.

The audience were anxious and bored.
What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear at the stage at all. A second-class actor took the place of him. We felt totally disappointed and cheated. After the show, I was hungry and tired. As your poster suggested, I intended to rest for a while at your restaurant. But when I got there, it had closed. In addition, the conductor didn't offer me any discounts, as you had advertised in the poster, when I bought the ticket.###What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear on the stage at all.

Modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways. First with a lot of advanced techniques being put into practical use, our living condition becomes more and more convenient and comfortable. When we look around in the house, it is easy to find things like these: a microwave oven, TV set, computer, etc. All these items of equippments are the applications of modern science. When you are planning to travel, you can choose a train, car or even a plane as your means of transportation. Without the development of modern technology, it may take your several years to reach the destination.###Modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways.

I think that in 100 years from now, the clothes fashion will be totaly different. In my apineon the world by it self will be different in temperature cased by global warming, as well as people will become more niceer, less  this will take place, so the clothes will mainly be maid from cotton with smooth colours like dark grean or gray. It will be comfotable close becaus the main point for any caind of clothe is to be comfatable. Also there will be no leather or fethers used in maiking these clothes becaus by that time the population of animals will foll and Green pease will be very strong community, much stronger and more pouful than it is now. So as we can think the Future Fashion can be pleasent or unpleasent for different people. The stile will be more or less simelar to each other and everyon will be setisfaid with its needs.###I think that in 100 years from now, the clothes fashion will be totally different.

I also would like to know why the musical show started at a quarter past eight instead of half past seven. I spent a lot of time waiting for the show to start.

Firstly I would like to talk about computers. A couple of years ago I bought a new computer and I had to learn all about them. Even though it was my first one I managed and I got to know pretty fast the way they work. Now, I'm just fascinated by the Internet and I spent at least half an hour every day surfing the net, visiting lots of webs and getting all kind of information for free.###Firstly I would like to talk about computers.

Several european companies like Nokia or Ericsson are focusing on mobiles and I have been told that in a couple of years it will be possible to send and e-mail either from the computer or from the mobile, which is going to be great.###I should not forget mobile phones.

During my stay in London I went to your Circle Theatre to see the musical 'Over the rainbow'. In the advertisment you promised a perfect evening out, but it wasn't. So with this letter I want to ask for some money back. Now I want to explain about the problems. It was very disappointing for me that the actor wasn't Danny Brook, how it was told in the advertisment. It was also told that the evening shows are starting at 19.30, but it started 20.15. I had to buy a £20 ticket because discounts were not available. After the show I wanted to go to the theatre restaurant with my friends, but it was closed because of  illness. So I want to ask for my money back, also because I had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the advertisment. I hope you will answer my letter and correct the problems in your theatre.###During my stay in London I went to your Circle Theatre to see the musical 'Over the rainbow'.

Modern technology has changed my daily life in the point that all I do is becoming more comfortable. For example when I have to write a letter or do my homework, I always write it on the computer. If I search for something like a telefonnumber or an adress I also look it up from the internet. I use also the internet when I need any informations, for example if I need them for school or private, for myself. A few years ago I had to go in a library and look it up in many books. Most that took a long time.###Modern technology has changed my daily life in the sense that everything I do is becoming easier.

Another important point for me is that things like listening to music or watching TV sounds better and the pictures on TV are being impoved, because the machines become more better. And also a good intention for me is the Handy, because everywhere I go I can talk to other people.###Another important point for me is that things like listening to music or watching TV sound better and the pictures on TV are being improved, because the machines become better.

Modern technology, such as computer, car and other else, changed my life in many different ways like communication, traveling and working. For example, a car, which is used from everyone everyday, changed my daily life in the sens that I don't need my dad or my mum to go to ice-skating or to go to work. I can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of the technology, but because I can show that I am responsable. With this car I can see the world, not exactly, but I can travel and visit other countries that Switzerland.###Modern technology, such as computers, cars and other things, have changed my life in many different ways such as communication, travelling and working.

Another piece of technology that changed my life is the computer because you can do many things with it, like homeworks, works, photos, but the most important at my eyes is the communication with my friends from different parts of the world by the web. This is a big walk in the technology and I can say that it is the most important for me because I like to have a lot of friends. So I spend almost one hour every day on the web. At last the piece of technology that I would like to bring out is the TV. This is a good one because you can see what is happening around you and everywhere else on Earth. Naturally technology is everywhere even in the kitchen, for example a special plate or something else, and I could talk a lot about them, but I think that the one thing here something are the most important in the change of my daily life . ###Another piece of technology that changed my life is the computer because you can do many things with it, like homework, work, photos, but the most important in my eyes is the communication with my friends from different parts of the world via the web.

First of all, I would like to say something about the starring: I went to the theatre because I wanted to see Danny Brook, but once there I found an actor who I had never heard about. So the main point of my visit had dissappeared.###First of all, I would like to say something about the star: I went to the theatre because I wanted to see Danny Brook, but once there I found an actor who I had never heard of.

Another point is the time when it started, exactly 45 minutes later. A serious theatre can't miss on such an important thing, the starting-time. I had to wait all that time in the street, because the hall was not big enough. Moreover, once I was going to pay for the tickets, I found another thing out: there were no discounts avaible.

It was late in the night, and Pat was thinking about something Nick had told her that afternoon: - "Don't tell Marie I was here". Nick was Marie's boyfriend, and Marie was a very good friend of hers. They were in the shopping centre, and the problem was that Nick wasn't alone, he was with a very beautiful girl. What could Pat do?

I had a very disappointing evening. First, Danny Brook doesn't play in "Over the rainbow", his paper was played by Danny De Vito. Also, the play started fourty five minutes late than the starting hour. I can understand that a play can start fifteen minutes late, but not fourty five. Second, my wife and me payed £20 for the tickets and we asked for discounts. The receptionist who gave me the tickets told me that no discounts were able that night. After a boring play, I decided to go to an theatre restaurant, but uncertainly it was closed. I decided to go home and prepare some sandwiches. The principal reason for I'm writting to you at the moment is that I want my money back, because I felt so disappointing with the theatre and also with the play.###I had a very disappointing evening.

An example could be the Internet. It changed my life, because with it I can discover more information than I can in a newspaper, and also information of all around the world, that possibly never I can access without the Internet. But, it is not only news or information. You can comunicate with people from place were you would never can imagine to have a trip because it will be too expensive. An extract could be the popular chats, where people write with the keyboard what they want to tell. But, if you don't like to use the keyboard to tell something or comunicateto communicate, you can use video conference, a sistem wich lets you can talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers. Also there is the possibility of download things to your pc like software, pictures and, also, music. The modern technologies make me am able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if I buy a reproductor, I can wear this music to everywere.###An example could be the Internet.

Also computers and mobile phones had evolutioned thanks to modern technologies. Without this evolution, we would probably still get on the ancient times. Who wants to return to the ancient times? No electricity, no canalized water, no healthy water, no TV's, no phones, no PC's.. I'm afraid that the people on the ancient times lived although they don't have anything of these things, but me and everyone of this times, I'm afraid that we wouldn't like return to this life. As well, I think that modern technologies are necessary, but also I think that they are so expensive, but with time, the price goes down. So, if the price goes down it  is because anything new is at the moment for sell. Is like a round tour.###Also computers and mobile phones have evolved thanks to modern technologies.

The first problem was the price of tickets. I expected to buy a ticket cheaply but no discounts were available. Another problem was that the show started forty-five minutes late. I found the theater rather noisy as I arrived very early to sit in the front row. Although I got a bit annoyed, I tried to have a good time.###The first problem was the price of tickets.

However, something wrong came up again. The actor 'Danny brook', whom you advertised in the brocher, did not play a part in the show. And I was really disappointed from the different actor's performance. He kept forgetting his lines. Finally, I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after the show, but it was closed because it was refurbishing interior.

Dear Manager: I am Angela Ounis and I am writting to you because I went to see 'Over the Rainbow', London's newest and best musical show. I am very disappointing at this evening's show. First of all, the starring that was supposed to be there (Danny Brook and Tina Truelove) weren't there, I was so enthusiastic about your starring, when I realized was a failure, even though they do good, it wasn't the same. I arrived there, at 19:15, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but started at 20:15, it cannot be possible that a schedule for a show can have had a big change. You go there to see a show and have a good time, not to wait forever until what you want. Also it was said that Discounts will be available, but I didn't received any discount as you were cheating us. I know that you have a big responsability but if you told something to people, do it. On the other hand, the theatre Restaurant was closed because they've got a problem with the schedule's organization. That was so uncomfortable, people was starving. I am so disappointed with this, that I am in all my right to ask for some money back, your theatre show wasn't what was expected. Please let me know . sincerely yours###Dear Manager: I am Angela Ounis and I am writing to you because I went to see 'Over the Rainbow', London's newest and best musical show.

First of all, my cousin, who lives there, had had many problems with the tickets. The starring changed and this was the worst surprise I could have had.

Dear sir, I'm writing to express my complaint about the organization of the musical show I went to last Saturday evening. According to your advertisement, there should have been Danny Brook, starring in all the scenes. Instead, you changed the actor without any warning, so I didn't find my favourite Danny Brook, with my total disappointment, as his substitute couldn't catch him up at all. And what about the starting time? I had to wait for about an hour, as the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Another thing that made me angry was that I couldn't have a discount. I was very annoyed about it: I only expected the discounts you had promised on the advertisement and, as I am a university student, I would have a right on it. At the top of everything, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was being restructurated, so I couldn't have my dinner either! It was a terrible evening out, so I ask you for a refund for all the troubles you caused me.

We live in the age of personal computers, of the internet, of the mobile phones, and now for me it's impossible to think of a world without them. It' already four years since I bought my first cellular phone (since then I changed it many times) and it is always very useful for me: everyone can speak with me wherever I am. When, for example, I go abroad I feel closer to my friend and to my family than before.###We live in the age of personal computers, of the Internet, of the mobile phone, and now for me it's impossible to think of a world without them.

I moved away that year, away to a whole new place and a whole new school. Once in a while my old schoolmates came and visited me and we had lots of fun together, just like the old times. However, I felt I could not talk to them about the problems I was having, the one problem about my parents getting a divorce.###I moved away that year, away to a whole new place and a whole new school.

When my parents told me the news, I was stunned, dazed. My dad began packing his things the very next day, to move to his new apartment where he would live while waiting for the divorce papers and signing them. That period of my life was one of the worst. I went into a depression, and not matter who tried to make me feel better, I only felt worse.###When my parents told me the news, I was stunned, dazed.

However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat. She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days. She told me she heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help. When she was comforting me I noticed she had changed. She was a person I could turn to, I could trust. She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do to anyone. Ever since, she gained my trust and I told her my feelings and secrets. Unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul. She kept every single one of my secrets well, and, not surprisingly, she became my best friend. Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager.###However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat.

First the musical show, Over the Rainbow, started at 20:15, and in the advertisement it was written that it would start at 19:30, then it also was written that the actor was Danny Brook, but in the show appeared a different actor, that was really disappointing.

Firstly, as I wanted to buy a ticket, I was informed that no discounts were available. However, the serious problems appeared later. Not only the play started 45 minutes after it was planned, but as the actors eventually appeared at the stage, have I also seen, that Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, who was very disappointing in his role. To make matters even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, without any information being given about the reason of it's closure.###Firstly, when I wanted to buy a ticket, I was informed that no discounts were available.

In my opinion, if the weather is so good people will very quickly forget about any winter clothes. What is more, the ground will be so hot, that going will only be possible in huge shoes, which should be massive, but not heavy at all. Another effect of the scorching weather could be, that people won't be allowed to get out of the building unless they wear specially designed caps or hats, made of materials, that aren't known yet.###In my opinion, if the weather is so good people will very quickly forget about any winter clothes.

The school finished and we, I mean Pat, Tim and me, didn't know what to do with plenty of spare time. I didn't wanted to spend that holiday with my parents in the country. I was old enough to go somewhere only with my friends. Tim gave a proposition about going at the sea by his new car. It seemed fantastic but we knew our parents would never agree. We had to find another way out. We planned to tell them that we were going for a summer camp in the mountains where we would practise French. Parents were very pleased and happy we are so ambisious. Of course, we didn't wanted to go there, it was just a "cover". We prepared tents and other relevant equipment and we were waiting.

When I read the advertisement first, I thought that it would be fun.###I recently had a week's holiday in London and during my stay, I went to the Circle Theatre to see "Over the Rainbow". To tell the truth, it was a very disappointing evening. When I first read the advertisement, I thought that it would be fun.
In the advertisement, it was written that the show was London's newest and best musical show. Well, it might be the newest one but certainly, it was not the best one. I thought that the actor of the show was Danny Brook, but he was not playing in the show. The actor was somebody else and this was something disappointing.###In the advertisement, it wrote that the show was London's newest and best musical show.

The show should have started at 19:30 but, it started at 20:15. Which means, I had to wait there for 45 minutes. And also, it was written that the discounts were available but they were not.###The show should have started at 19:30 but, it started at 20:15 which meant, I had to wait there for 45 minutes.

People were using candles to see around them. In winter, they used to fire some woods to keep warm, "Computer" was a word that nobody had known the meaning of it. As my mum told me, when she was young, only a few people had televisions in their houses. And of course, they were black-and white. Their hobies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything.###People used candles to see around them. In winter, they used to burn some wood to keep warm.

Modern technology has changed our daily life a lot. We are using mobile phones so it doesn't matter if we are in a crowded city or on a desert. You can communicate with other people any time you want. Nearly 90 per cent of people know how to use a computer and computers are used in every section of our lives. We also have the "internet", by which you can learn something about the world in less than a minute.###Modern technology has changed our daily life a lot.

First of all, there were any different actor. I was disappointed. The other point is that the organization was very bad. For example, it is said the show starts at 19.30 but it started at 20:15. I have waited around one hour. Now I have a cold because it was so cold that evening. Thirdly, I would like to enquire is about the tickets. Firstly, twenty pounds are a lot of money for such a organization, on the other hand it is said that a discount is available. It is false, I have paid twenty pounds.###First of all, there were any different actors. I was disappointed. The other point is that the organization was very bad.

What other I would like ask is that why it is said this is the London's newest and best musical show. I can mention it is the worst musical show. And I was invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show. But it was closed because there were not anything to drink or to eat. Finally it was not the perfect evening out.###The other thing I would like to ask is that why it is said this is the London's newest and best musical show. I can say it is the worst musical show.

Firstly, I would like to mention is that in our daily life we always use some technological machines. For instance, a TV-set, stereo, microwave oven and others. Another point is that with the help of the technology we can communicate with the whole world. Without doubt, the discovering of the computer is the most important technological event. It is very useful. Almost everything is connected to the computers. For example, education, researching of the Universe and others.###Firstly, I would like to mention is that in our daily life we always use some technological appliances.

To start with, the show, which was supposed to start on 19:30 started on 20:15 so you can understand that we were 45 minutes late getting out as well. Then, they were not any discounts available for the tickets as it was written on the advertisement. What's more the theatre restaurant was closed for some reasons and we couldn't get anything to drink or eat after the show. On top of everything, Danny Brook, the star of the night, was absent and his role was performed by a different actor. You can understand how disappointing this was for all of us.###To start with, the show, which was supposed to start on 19:30 started on 20:15 so you can understand that we were 45 minutes late getting out as well.

In my opinion, there are two possible fashions for the future. If humans turn to be more free from social rules, I think that their dressing will also be very extreme and unlimited. There will be a variety of colours and fashion styles. Everybody will wear anything he/she likes, choosing clothes from any century they wishe without this being strange. On the other hand, if human society turns to be stricher and more limited, there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing, formed by the needs of the society. All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule around. Perhaps the style of their dressing will indicate their position in society too.###In my opinion, there are two possible fashions for the future.

How has modern technology changed my daily life. A century ago, when a farmer took the horses out of the stable and put the plouge behind them, we've got the word "time". Why not talk about the social life just sitting around a table without no rush.###How has modern technology changed my daily life?

In modern days we have to wear a mobile phone. I visited an airport some days ago and in nearly every crowded corner, I could see those busy people who are always on their way somewhere. I heard the different phone signals, and, what a miracle, you can change them on the train when you are restless. A new word has appeared in those days, a technical proof of this is the computer. I can send and save information and the possibilities are uncountless.

I must say a few words about the new electrical cars which surely will have a central role to play, exspecially today when fuel is so expensive.

In the advertisment for the show you said that one of the starring was going to be Danny Brook, and to my surprise it was a different actor, and it realy disapoint me. Then the show was suppost to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15, more than half an hour later. I cuold read in the advertisment that there were some discounts available but there werent. And the restorant of the theatre was being pait, so I could not go there as you said in the advertisment.###In the advertisement for the show you said that one of the stars was going to be Danny Brook, and to my surprise there was a different actor, and that really disappoint me.

To begin with, the actor the advertisement showed did not come, which I found it in very bad taste, and disappointing. Moreover, the show started at a quarter past eight, forty-five minutes later than it might have been. I paid twenty pounds for my ticket because, as you may know, there were not any discounts available. It is for this reason, I think you should return me some money back.###To begin with, the actor the advertisement showed did not appear, which I found it very rude, and disappointing.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It was our last school year, so we decided to organize a trip to celebrate the fact we had finally finished it. We knew that our parents wouldn't let us to travel alone so we had to invent a story to avoid they could realize what happened. Kim, Kate and Pat told their parents they were going to travel with the school and so, did I. We were excited and we started to organized everything. We booked some rooms in a hotel, next to the beach, and we bought all the useful things we were going to need. It seemed like the perfect holiday but it wasn't. Pat was in love with my eldest brother, whose name is Jon (I have never got on well with him). Pat told him our idea. Pour Pat, she didn't know my brother, she didn't know how he was.

Last week I was in London. On Friday we, my friend and I, visited your Theater to see 'Over the rainbow'. It should has been my best evening that week, unfortunatly it wasn't. The first thing that happen was that the show didn't start on time. Instead of 730 am as your advertisment said, it started at 815 am. In the meantime we tried to get our money back to do something else, but that was impossible. When the show started Danny Brook was not acting, witch was a great dissapointment for us both.

I was angry because the show started at 20:15 instead of 19.30, too.

I suggest you should solve these problems quickly.

I think people don't realize how much technology rules their life. Neither do I. In particular I'd like to talk about the Internet. I think that the Internet has changed my daily life most of all. In fact, now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for exemple, in the morning and receive back their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing. Therefore I regard the Internet as a quite powerful tool and I believe it has given more strenght to relations among people. In fact people meet on the Net; they learn many things; they stay in touch with friends who are abroad; and sometimes they even fall in love on the net.###I think people don't realize how much technology rules their life.

Firstly, I have had no discount at paying. secondly there was a delay which got me into trouble, After the show I couldn't catch my train.

In my opinion, I think clothes will be a lot differente in 100 years later compare to now. As new materials are made and new styles are created either by designers or people themselves, which leads to changes in fashion, but on the other hand come materials will probably still be used such as jeans, which was invented ages ago in America. and people nowadays still use jeans as a common material. If you walk out on to the street now, you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made with jeans, which is incredibly surprising!###In my opinion, clothes will be a lot different in 100 years' time.

If you walk out on to the street now, you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made of denim, which is incredibly surprising!
From my point of view, I think people will wear more clothes that are see-through in particular.

According to the advertisement, which appeared in one of the London's newspapers, I would like to present you with some of my complaines about your musical spectacle. Firstly, I would like to say that the cast, which you "offered", has been changed. The man who played the main male role was different than this one, who was mentioned in the advertisement. Secondly, the time when your musical should start has been changed, making your show delayed for nearlly one hour! In your offer I noticed an information about discounts which were supposed to be available - no, they were not! Another "defect" in the advertisement was an "invitation" to the restaurant after the show. For unknown for me reasons, I found the restaurant closed (there was no information telling about a cause of closing it). Finally, you guaranteed "a perfect evening out", but for me it was the worst visit in the theatre in two years time.###Considering the advertisement, which appeared in one of the London's newspapers, I would like to present you with some of my complaints about your musical spectacle.

In my opinion, my daily life is full of modern technology. I meet her "at every corner": at home, at school, in the backyard and so on. It also changed my life-style for the better - I think.

I can do my homework on a computer, prepare for the class test by searching for information in the Internet and use a mobile phone every time when I want to connect with one of my parents.###In my opinion, my daily life is full of modern technology.

In the advirtisement it is written that Danny Brook was in the starring role. However I didn't see him all the night. There was another actor instead of him.

And so far there wasn't any discounts available which is written to be "available" in the advirtisement. I went to the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because of the re-decoration progress inside. You should have written it in the advirtisement.

Today every 5 out of 10 pupil can use a computer basicly. And almost everybody has a television in their homes. These 2 devices make my life easier. I can't go out all the time or be with my friends to have fun. So I watch Tv at home instead of sitting in a chair looking out of a window. I play on the computer more than watching Tv when I get bored.###Today 5 out of every 10 pupils can use a computer basically. And almost everybody has a television in their homes.

After the boring show finished, I was hungry and I decided to go to your theatre restaurant but the restaurant was closed after 19.00. So what's the point of to say 'visit our restaurant after the show'?###But when the show started, they said Danny wasn't there because of his illness and I felt very upset and dismayed about it because the experience I had was unlike what the advertisement promised.

This happened in the Thursday afternoon. When everyone finished their lunch, they all got into their classrooms quickly because they all knew that the headmaster would walk round the school every Thursday. But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writting something on the board. Unfortunately, one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit directly to the headmaster's head. Everyone was laughing and the headmaster's face was full of anger. He then punished Jon but the one who did it was Tim so Jon was very angry and he said something bad about the headmaster among us. Pat heard that and he went to see the headmaster straight after school. The headmaster went to see Jon and Tim and punished them for their bad behaviours.###This happened on the Thursday afternoon.

When I become your's advertisment concerning the show "Over the Rainbow" I thought that I'll have a great evening, but unfortunatelly it was a big disappointment for me. Maybe I start for the beginning. First of all, Danny Brook - the main actor in this musical - was abbsend. The show had a 45 minutes delay - what a shame! You also offered discounts, whot kind of discounts? I haven't seen any! I was with my son (11 years old) and I had to paid a full-prize for his ticket. Becouse the show was very long, we were getting hungry but of course your's theatre restaurants was closed because of the holiday.###When I became your advertisement concerning the show "Over the Rainbow" I thought that I'd have a great evening, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment for me.

Madrid, 17 - June - 2000 Dear SIR/MADAM, My name is ....I am working as an actor for The Spanish Royal Theatre. I had spent the hole of last week in London with one of my colleagues. Sunday night we went to your theatre. We thought that going to the musical show "Over The Rainbow" was (as you say in your advertisement) the perfect evening out and the perfect end of our stay in your city. But from the beginning we found a lot of problems. Despite we are actors we had to pay for a full ticket because the discounts you promise are not available on Sundays. We tried to complain but the girl at the tickets desk was very unpolite. However, we decided to get into the show. Danny Brook is a good friend of mine and our purpose was to give him a surprise. You can imagine how were our faces like when we saw that it was not Danny, but Peter Fox, who was on the stage. Nevertheless we decided to stay there till the end of the show and to take dinner in your restaurant, where we were supposed to meet some friends; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out. I am sure that the restaurant closed at its closing-hour but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late. As you can read it was not our "perfect evening out" at all. I was really disappointed. I realize that managing a theatre is a hard work but I have to ask you for the money of the tickets back. Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes on the advertisement, before the starting time of the show.

Technology makes easier the work at home. I can't imagine how my life would be without a washing machine, a drier or a fridge. During the winter, when it is raining, you can have your clothes dry in less that thirty minutes. That's fantastic.###Technology makes housework.

Technology has also been a great help in my everyday work. I am thinking mostly on computers. Being a journalist I have to write lots of pages every day.

Also, the e-mail system is really hepful. Thanks to the advance of the Internet I can contact lots of colleagues all around the world everyday (and with the minimum cost).

My girlfriend and I read an advertisement about the show "Over the Rainbow", which is very popular. She is fond of the actor Danny Brook so I decided to buy two tickets, provided there were discounts available. When we asked for discounts tickets, we were said there never were discount offers and that we had to pay for the highest tickets - £20 each - because we were not English students. We were annoyed about it but we paid off. We took our places, and began chatting with other people. We had to wait until 8.15 pm before it started, whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm! Moreover, we were astonished that another actor we did not know was playing the role of Danny Brook. My girlfriend was very upset and so was I.###My girlfriend and I read an advertisement for the show "Over the Rainbow", which is very popular.

After that we thought we could have a drink in your theatre restaurant but it was closed because the decorations were being changed. Finally we had the worst evening I have ever imagined, it was definitely not the "perfect evening" as written in the adverstiment.###After that we thought we could have a drink in your theatre restaurant but it was closed because the decor was being changed.

How interesting it is to imagine what kind of clothes people will wear in about a hundred years from now. Fashion is changing so quickly that all our dreams about clothes can become true. But let's see my point of view. In a hundred years, the clothes would certainly be totally differents than ours. Materials, textures and colours change, and are minds too.###How interesting it is to imagine what kind of clothes people will wear in about a hundred years from now.

So I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like bottles of aluminium. And I hope colours won't be dark and sad but very bright and enjoyable to see.###So I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like aluminium bottles.

I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans. Syntethic materials have grown up and become very popular so it would keep going on. But maybe the shape of the clothes will changed: large pants as "baggy", or trousers with many pockets as we see today. For women, clothes change more than for men's. It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothes. I guess they will wear a sort of tunique upon a shirt and a skirt, or more male clothes because they want to change. Finally it's very difficult to say that .###I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans.

Plus, I felt very pleased when I heard that Danny Brook was part of the play: he used to be an old friend of mine in Highschool and perchance I have found him back here!

Really, what a mess in the administration.

The first thing I think of is the internet. What a great invention! It allows me to learn anything without having to travel through many libraries as I used to do.

The first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer. I spend most of my time in front of the computer, either working or playing. Of course this sometimes is an advantage, when for example the computer helps me to do my job easier, but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends. But unfortunately I cannot live without a computer. The first thing I do in the morning is start up my computer, check if I have any new e-mails, check my electronic calendar and then go to work, where I always work with a computer.

According to the advert, it says clearly that discounts are available, but when I was buying the tickets, I did not have this offer. As a result, I had to pay the full price of £15. The second point is that the show had a delay of about 30 minutes. Although I believe there must have been problems, I expect your company managed to sort it out in the quickest way. Apart from that, the most disappointing fact is that there were different actors instead of Danny brook and Tina Truelove, for whom I was coming. After the show we went to the Theatre restaurant, but it was closed due to the refurbishment.###The advert clearly says that discounts are available, but when I was buying the tickets, I did not have this offer. As a result, I had to pay the full price of £15. The second point is that the show had a delay of about 30 minutes.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. My story had already been spread out the next day. Although failing in the exams wasn't really a big deal, it was awful that people kept mentiong it. I thought I was not going to survive after failing the exams and my best friend had been untrustful. but this idea was soon be put off since I noticed on the newspaper that I had won the writing competition. I couldn't believe my luck, I was really sure that I won a return ticket to the Meditarenian Sea. During the trip, I made friends with other people who had also won the competition in their towns. They were so kind to me that we soon became good friends. The last few days, we spent our time on sightseeing and shopping. I must admit that it was the greatest time I have ever had in my life. On the last day when I was packing and getting ready to leave, I realised I had lost my passport and tickets. A horrible thought suddenly came into my mind. My bad luck had never left me. It had only hidden away from me and when there was a chance, it was going to give me a 'surprise'.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

How has modern techology changed my daily life. Fifty years ago people even didn't think that after 2000 years they would have another life. When Thomas Adison invented an electric light, it was the greatest invention for people of that centure. And nowadays modern technology can change all our life. I mean, almost everyone has now a car, a computer, a mobil phone and even an airplane. My life is changing too. First of all, now I can phone my friends and parents from every place, I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the internet. Second, modern technology helps me in the kitchen. Coocking became faster with the help of the microwave. What is more, Modern technology prevents different illnesses. Further more, yesterday I've heard that every man could fly to the space without any experience, it is great, from my point of view, that in 2050 the year everybody will fly to the space.###How has modern technology changed my daily life?

But, Mark, Pat and I were planning a birthday-party for Sally on June 2 at her own home. It should have been "surprising". Sally's husband is now in Singapore on business, so she had to spend her birthday without him. Considering her loneliness, we made every effort to please her and to encourage her; because she was loved by everybody for her gentle, kind and lovely character. She was not so lucky in her life. Her parents already died when she was in the high-school. She has no brothers and sisters. After marriage, Sally and her husband Nigel realized that they would not be able to have their children. In spite of such difficulties, she always shows a pretty, charming smile to us.###But, Mark, Pat and I were planning a birthday party for Sally on June 2 at her own home.

One of the essential developement is in the form of transportation. The invention of cars, planes, trains and other similar forms of transportation have enabled us to go from one place to another with no time. This enables us to save a great deal of time and effort. Quite recently, in my country electrical bicycles have been invented. This, compared to the traditional bicycle, is less physically painstaking and less time consuming and therefore lets me travel to my destination in a small amount of time with hardly no effort at all. This has made my life easier. On the other hand, I feel as though I am becoming lazier and exercising less.###One of the essential development has been in our means of transportation.

If the marlin could speak it would have told the old man's the same thing. When the old man won the fight he felt sorry but pleased. He respected and still loves it. But, afterwards, the life's rule is MORS TUA VITA MEA and that's the most difficulty thing to face up to.###If the marlin could speak it would have told the old man the same thing.

I am writing with reference to Over the Rainbow, the musical show, which I went to see at the Circle Theatre last night. Being a theatre lover, I am always looking forward to seeing new musicals, but unfortunately, this particular one was very disappointing.###I am writing with reference to Over the Rainbow, the musical show, which I went to see at the Circle Theatre last night.

First of all, Danny Brook was not starring, even though it was stated in your advertisement that he would perform, but the main role was played by an unknown actor. Secondly, I had to wait for forty five minutes for the show to start, and it was 20:15 (not 19:30) when the curtain went up.###First of all, Danny Brook was not starring, even though it was stated in your advertisement that he would perform, but the main role was played by an unknown actor.

Another disappointing thing was that I could not get any student discount, even that your advertisement promised them. To make things even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, because of the roof repairs.###Another disappointing thing was that I could not get a student discount, even though your advertisement promised them.

I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes. There will be a mixture of styles from different times of the past, so if you feel like a medieval princess, you can dress like one. A new technology and science will change fabrics, so they will change their colour during the day.###I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes.

Here are the problems of your show. In your advertisement, it says that Danny Brook will act but he did not. It was a different actor and I was very disappointed. It says that the show starts at 14:30 and 19:30 but the show started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes late.###Here are the problems with your show.

The price of the ticket was another problem. Your advertisement says 'discounts available' but it was not available. I did not get a discount. I really liked your idea of visiting your theatre restaurant, but because of the late start of the show, the restaurant was closed by the end of the show.###The price of the ticket was another problem.

Dear Sir or Madam, I recently went to The Circle Theatre in order to see Over the Rainbow, and it has been quite deceiving. I am writing to you to complaint about five or six utterly outrageous facts. In the advertisement for the show, which I have picked up in the hall of the theatre, are there about five points which were not respected. To begin with, as far as the starring is concerned, Danny Brook should have performed as the main character, and I saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not. Insofar as I came here especially to see him play, I have been very deceived, and this could be the understatement of the year, inasmuch as he is my favorite actor. Apart from it, the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! Could you explain to me the reasons of such a huge late? Thirdly, the ad mentionned possible discounts. Personnaly speaking, I didn't saw it and even didn't heard of it: I have asked about it, but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts. On top of that, the restaurant was closed for renovations! How can you dare putting an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know that is closed? To put it in a nutshell, and quite honestly, I would like to emphasize on the fact that I did not spent a "perfect evening out" at all, such as it is mentionnedpromised in the ad. For all these reasons, I would like, dear Sir or Madam, that you give me my money back. I am looking forward to hear from you.

Everything had begun when Paul went downstairs of the Heavy Sleep. As he closed his eyes, he started to travel across the dark paths of his councience.

While he was wandering in the depths of the forest he felt a little tired and sat on a grey huge stone, on the top of which he could stare across the whole woods.###While he was wandering in the depths of the forest he felt a little tired and sat on a huge grey stone, on the top of which he could stare across the whole wood.
All of a sudden, a weird creature popped into his dream. She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree. Paul was wandering wether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words, "I am glad to meet you, Paul." The boy could not beleive to what he was hearing. How did the beast knew his name? "You see, I am a mere product of your mind, but I would like to go out of the Heavy Sleep.

How did the beast know his name? "You see, I am a mere product of your mind, but I would like to get out of the Heavy Sleep. Please, bring me with you, into your reality!"
At these words, Paul suddently awoke. Relieved, he thought that bringing the creature in his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie, and with it, threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape, when he heard a creepy sound under his bed. He jumped out of his room, locked the door and found his brother, Pat. He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat it.###At these words, Paul suddenly awoke.

First of all, I was really expecting to see Danny Brook, my favourite actor. However, he was not on the stage that day. Secondally the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything. It was a waste of time. I also thought that there should have been discounts for students, which in fact was not available and I had to pay for the normal price. Furthur more, the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay. I had to go home without eating a dinner, though I was really hungry.###First of all, I was really expecting to see Danny Brook, my favourite actor. However, he was not on the stage that day.

Moreover I would like to tell you that the show should have begun at 19:30 but it started with a delay of 45 minutes. I do not think that this delay is acceptable. Furthermore you have mentioned some discounts in your advertisment, but I had to pay the full price although I am a student.###Moreover I would like to tell you that the show should have begun at 19:30 but it started after a delay of 45 minutes.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat and I have been friends for a long time. We have had a lot of fun together because we had the same interests. When we were 15 years old we decided to drive with my mother's car on a day when my parents were absent. I told Pat to keep in mind that my parents would be very angry if they got to know about that. Pat promised me to tell nobody about our purpose. Two days later my father asked me whether I had thought at any time of to drive a car without a drivers license because he had heard about that from some parents of my friends at school. He told me for two hours what could happen if I would do that. I was very surprised because Pat and I were along when we decided to do that.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

I passed one week in London and during my visit I had the fortune to visit "Over the rainbow" in your theatre. But I was not very satisfied after my "perfect evening" out. The advertisement for the Musical Show was very good, but the information was not correct. You wrote that the favourite actor will be Danny Brook but there was another one who was really disappointing.

Because of the advertisement I thought that I can get a discount on the tickets available but I couldn't. After the show I need to drink something in the theatre restaurant like the advertisement it concieved, but it was closed. And there was no reason why .###I spent one week in London and during my visit I had the good fortune to see "Over the rainbow" at your theatre.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secretes. This was the only reason why that she had not got a lot of friends. When Pat first came new into a class or a groupe of teenagers there were no problems. But after a few time the others have seen that Pat can't keep secrets. So they stopped nearly immediately to tell her something important. Sometimes it finished like this that the others only said: "Hello, how are you?" and then went away without listening to the answer. This made Pat sad and she became very quiet. During the day she worked hard that she had not to think too much. But at night, when it became dark the dreams were coming. She dreamed about good friends, the time that was long passed by and she dreamed from someone who she can tell her own secrets.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

We were very disappointed! Of course, the show didn't start on time. No reasons or excuses were given.

First of all, the most important singer, Danny Brook, was not singing. You should have at least informed the public because most of the people there came to see him.

The ways of transport are improving a lot this times. The cars are really useful and a lot more faster than waking or cycling. But cars created pollution: for exemple the green house effect.

Pat was a teacher for english as a foreign language. Sometimes he had liked to surprise his class with a test to see how good they would be when they could not have learned for it in advance.

Firstly, I was really disappointed when I realised that the actor Danny Brook was not performing due to personal reasons, I like this actor very much and it was not the same without him. Moreover, the musical show was supposed to start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15, making all the spectators wait for nearly an hour.###Firstly, I was really disappointed when I realised that the actor Danny Brook was not performing for personal reasons.

To make matters worse, there were not ticket discounts such as you advertised. Because of this I had to buy a ticket for the cheapest and worst seat available.

It is said that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement. However, there was a different, unknown actor in that.

After the show, I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed because of no reason.###It said in the advertisement that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.

From my point of view, young people tend to wear the clothes which they can show their skin. For example, short skirts and tops like an under-wear. I think young people would wear smaller clothes which make they look like they are almost naked even in winter. I suppose that a scientist could invent new kinds of materials which are warm and thick. It could be happened that people wear the clothes which ancient people used to wear, like skirts made of leaves.###In my opinion, young people tend to wear the clothes which they can show their skin.

I became quickly bored by this hypocrital attention they had for me. They didn't stop giving me advice or telling me what to do with my money.

Second, I went to the theatre at exactly seven thirty in the evening. However, the show started 45 minutes later. I wasted time too much for waiting. It was not good to me, cause I had only one week holiday in London. Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed with the word "Stuff vacation" on the front door after the show.

However, if they have some special day when like an important public day or special day of their life, they will wear very different kinds of clothes which was you have never seen before. Some of that will be very strange to our eyes, but some of the others will be familiar to us.

I am writing to you about your theatre: 'over the rainbow'. I went to a performance and I am very disappointed. Firstly, your advertisement said the actor would be Danny Brook, but it was not. It played an other one who played very bad. Secondly, the musical should start on 19.30, but we had to wait until 20.15! It was boring that nothing happend for such a long time on the stage. Did you know that you have no discounts on your tickets? I could not believe that. Why do you write things on your advertisement when nothing is true? And finally, I would have had my dinner after this disappointment musical and thougt I would go to 'Theatre restaurant'. But how can it be, it was closed!###I am writing to you about your production: 'over the rainbow'. I went to a performance and I am very disappointed.

I have dout when somebody said, that the fashion of the future would be different. I think it is very difficult to change the clothes and the fashion so much again. We have so many kind of clothes and fashion behind our old generations. Maybe, the skirts will be shorter and the colours brighter, the shoes moderner so that you can not walk in them anymore.###I had doubt when somebody said, that the fashion of the future would be different.

First of all, I have to say that the advertisement was totally different of what I saw there. For example, the actors that were announced as to take part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, the discounts were not available and, the principal point: it started forty five minutes later. Then, to complete this terrible night, the restaurant was closed. I wonder if you could explain to me why.###First of all, I have to say that the advertisement promised something totally different from what I saw there.

The huge growth of technology has brought lots of good aspects to my life, like the facility to be informed about everything that is happening around the world with the best image in my cab TV and in my computer. Without leaving my bedroom, I can go anywhere using the Internet. On the other hand, the excess of comodity can led us, in the future, to a completely "cold" world, because of the distance between people that can be caused.

Unfortunately, I've been really disappointed.

Firstly, I would like to say that I am very disappointed and upset with the show I saw. To begin my complains I can start with the actor - who was a different one to the one advertised, not Danny Brook. Tina Truelove performed marvellous, but him, I think he is a "street actor" from Covent Garden. Even worse it was the delay, the Show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, that drove me mad.###Firstly, I would like to say that I am very disappointed and upset with the show I saw.

I am a student visiting London for one week only and I asked for a discount ticket, I could not get it, it was really unfair, I paid the normal price.

I would like to tell you that I was really disappointed with my evening I at your theatre. At first when I came I hoped to see Danny Brook on the stage, but there was a totally different actor. As it is said in the advertisment the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes, because by the programme it started at 20.15, but that was not the end of the story, in your advertisment it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets, that was not true! I was not still very disappointed, because I hoped that I will have a good meal with a glass of wine in the restaurant, which I could have according to your advertisment, but what did I not realised, it was closed, because the chef was in the hospital.###I would like to tell you that I was really disappointed with my evening I at your theatre.

Dear Sir Brown, I'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw. I hadn't a good time! Firstly, Danny Brook didn't act. There was an other actor, James Kee, but I didn't like him! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he wasn't there. In addition to that, the show didn't start at 20.15; so it ended at 23.45 and I couldn't go to a meeting. I'm very disappointed for all these problems! Your theatre is very disorganized! The ticket's price was £20 and there wasn't any discount! After the show, I wanted to eat something, but the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was in Italy for a special course. I hadn't a great fun, so I ask for that money back. Your faithfully###Dear Sir Brown, I'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw. I didn't have a good time!

To start with, the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove didn't perform as told. They were replaced by some unknown actors who had certainly never performed in a musical.

There is one point I want to make clear, I don't begrudge Pat anything. I believe this is a rule of society, it's a sort of group behaviour, and belongs to the childhood and the teenage years. We all speak or have spoken of our neighbours, family, classmates, workmates, friends in bad terms. That is only human.###There is one point I want to make clear, I don't begrudge Pat anything.

According to me what is more to regret is when now we full-growns continue to act with this bad habit. The criticism spirit has to be preserved but we must keep our secrets.

So, it's very important to be a person than can keep secrets, even your own secrets, or a friend's one. One of the most beautiful things on the world is the true and loyal friendship.

I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely dissapointed about the show. I got to the theatre at 18:30 because I wanted to have a drink before I get to the hall so I got there earlier. The show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. It was about fourty five minutes later than the original starting time. I was just a bit upset but I wasn't that upset much at that time. The thing which made me really upset was the actor. The actor should be Danny Brook but it was another man who I haven't seen before. I liked Danny Brook so much and I was expecting to see him but you didn't even mention about that that actor was going to change to another guy. This thing shouldn't be happened.###I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely disappointed by the show.

The advertisement promised there would be my favorite star, Danny Brook, but there was an other actor who could not play his part as well as Danny Brook. In addition, the performance started 45 minutes later, so we couldn't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it had been closed already. More over, when I was buying our tickets, there weren't any discounts in spite of the fact that my wife and me are both on a pension. As a result, our evening was completely spoiled.

Secondly, the show has started with a delay of 45 minutes, and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed.

Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about the arrangements for the musical show "Over the Rainbow". I was spending some days in London and enjoyed a lot the idea of seeing this show. All my disappointment started when we noticed that there were no discounts available for the tickets, but as we wanted to see Danny Brook's performance, we decided to buy them anyway. We got really upset when we realized he was being substituted. The show was scheduled for 19:30 but it only started at 20:15. Besides the boredom of having waited for forty-five minutes, we were not allowed to visit the restaurant after the show, since it was already closed by the time the show finished. As it was not our perfect evening out, as you suggested in your advertisement, we would like to know if it would be possible for us to get a refund. I look forward to your response.

Moreover it was written in the advertisement that the musical was between 14:30-19:30. Suprisingly the show started at 20:15. That destroyed all my plans.

Yesterday Larry suggested going to the cinema after school. This was the most wonderful suggestion I have ever had. Going to the cinema with the boy I love. It sounded really good. Of course I accepted immidiately. I was like walking on the clouds for the whole day until I saw Pat running towards me. I suddenly remembered that I promised Pat to help her with her history homework. She came near to me and said "Ready for this evening? Don't forget bringing your history books." She was very nervous because she was about to fail. I told her that I want to tell her something. Then I explained what has happened that morning. She was about to cry. "I see. You choose Larry, but I thought that I was your best friend." After hearing this, I told her that I am deeply in love with Larry. I told her not to tell this anyone. She said OK angrily.###Yesterday Larry suggested going to the cinema after school. This was the most wonderful suggestion I have ever had. Going to the cinema with the boy I love.

After school Larry and I went to the cinema, but on the enterance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us. Larry told me that she is his girlfriend and then I told them I had to go home. When they asked me the reason I told them that I promised my Mom to be with her. They said OK and I went home. When I closed my bedroom's door I burst into tears.

I'm writing to you in order to complain about this show. The problems started when we arrived at the Theatre: my 6 year old son had to pay the full price. Then, even if we could enter in the room, the show didn't start before 20:15, which is 45 minutes later than expects. Indeed, we are still waiting on Danny Brook who was not in the piece. And last, at the end of the program, we would like to have a drink in the theatre Restaurant, but it was already closed due to the poor attendance.###I'm writing to you in order to complain about this show.

In fact, modern technology was already very popular and comonly used when I was born, so I cannot say that it changed my life rapidly. But I am also sure, that my life would be different without it.

The fisherman kills many sharks with different weapons, but when he reaches port there is only the head, tail and bones left of the huge swordfish. Mr. Hemingway makes this simple story a real adventure. He make you experience in detail all the struggles the fisherman has when he fights with the swordfish and the sharks. The fisherman is a typical old, strong and lonely hero of Mr. Hemingway. This tale is very amazing and it is no surprise Mr. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for it.###On his way back home to port he is attacked by sharks who eat caught piece by piece.

After reading your advertisement. I went to your theatre to see 'Over the rainbow' last night. I was excited to see it. But everything was terrible and different from your advertisement. First of all the actor was different. So I was disappointed. I had wanted to see Danny Brook in the show. The movie started 20.15 not 19.30. You wrote 'discouts available' but they didn't offer any discount. After the show, I couldn't have my dinner in your theatre restaurant. The restaurant was closed because of being repaired.###After reading your advertisement. I went to your theatre to see 'Over the rainbow' last night. I was excited to see it.

I have much housework to be done from early morning until late evening. I always use many electric products; washing machine, dish-washer, vacuum cleaner, blender, juice, fridge. I think I can have my spare time owing to these thing. For example if I don't have a washing machine, I will have to wash all the clothes myself. Then it takes about 1 hour or one and a half to wash. During the washing machine is whirring, I can get my time. So I can read my book or do another thing. Also I can't imagine my life without a car. It would be terrible. Now I can't live without them.###I have a lot of housework to do from early morning until late evening.

The first problem was about the actors. In the advertisment it was clearly written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play the main roles. But I was very disappointed when I didn't see them on the stage. The second problem was the time of the play. The advertisment said that the show would start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. I was waiting for the show for a half-an-hour! The third problem were the discounts. The advertisment said that they would be available but they were not. The last problem was the theatre restaurant. It was written in the advertisment that I could visit your theatre restaurant after the show, but unfortunatelly it was closed.###The first problem was about the actors.

First of all, the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor. Surprisingly, he never appeared on the stage, during the play. Therefore, the theatre or the company is lying. Secondly, the show started one hour and fifteen minutes past after. We arrived at the theatre in time and we had to wait all that time until the show began. Finally, when I asked about the discounts, an agressive employee refused to answer me. He stayed looking at me and laughing. It was incredible. The evening was a horrible surprise, completely different from the promise written in the advertisement.###First of all, the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor.

"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets." I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told her everything about Lynne Harter, our new collegue at school. However, I have to admit that I told her my own opinion. Well, it was the beginning of my tragedy. So, I told Pat that Lynne was ugly, fat like a cow, and extremely agressive. But I couldn't shut my mouth, I continued: "You can't believe it, Pat, she wears trousers like a men and green flowery blouses." Of course, my friend and I were laughing during half an hour. Two days after, when Pat came back to my school, and she met Mr Harter, our head teacher, she told him everything about Ann1. In that precisely moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter's niece. I know it's my fault.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so he told his mother how his brother Jim lost her suit suitcase on the train. Jim's mum didn't want him to take her suitcase, but he did it. So a morning he reached Victoria Station with the suitcase and take the train for the countryside where he had to work. But when he walked out of the station he realised that he have lost the suitcase on the train. Then he waited for the next train to London and he caught it.

All this story was a secret but Pat realived it to his mother.

Modern technology changed our lifes in many ways, when I have to wake up earlier I use my alarm clock, if I have to wash my teeth I use my toothbrush with a little of toothpaste. I use my desk to study which was made with trees cut down and emsamblish by machines more powerful than handwork. Even though, this is not enough and the technology created a better way of communication, first there were letters, after telephones and now we can write letters and receive them through the internet. It is not necessary to imagine things, you can travel all around by just making a click with your mouse and you are there. If I am hungry I open the refrigerator and take foods and cook it with a microwave.###Modern technology changed our lives in many ways: when I have to wake up earlier I use my alarm clock, if I have to wash my teeth I use my toothbrush with a little of toothpaste.

Another problem I had was with the time of the performance. I was going to begin at 19.30 but It began at 20.15 and the problem was that It was raining.

I met Pat when we were children. We went at the same school and were at the same class. I liked a boy who was in the same class. I told her that and she assured me that she wouldn't say it to him. When we finished at our primary school we went at the same secundary school too, but we were in different classes. We went out every weekends. And when we finished at the secundary school, I decided go to a foreign University. I spend five years there, although I came back all summers and we continued going out as we did before. When I finished I return to my city to find a job.###I met Pat when we were children. We went to the same school and were in the same class. I liked a boy who was in the same class.

Dear Sir, I'm writing this letter to you because I'm very disappointed and I believe you have to hang me some money back. Last week I was in London to see your new musical show. Before I bought my ticket and booked train and hotel reservations I'd read a lot of good reviews about that show and I thought it was a great moment to share with friends. But that evening became a real nightmare! Firstly, your advertisement is a real lie. Discounts available?? False and not true! Then the show was late starting, we had been waiting for a long long time before it started. But finally it started.. and what!! Danny Brook wasn't on the stage! I saw a young actor who I've never seen before and who seemed not to know by heart his role! Shame on you! After that "show" we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurand but what a surprise! It was closed (of course) and why? A general strike... It wasn't at all a perfect evening. I'm not pleased. I would weep if I wasn't so angry. To summarize, I want that you hangto give me my money back and very quickly.

Firstly I'd like to complain about the actor of the show. On your advertisement you say that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are starring in the play but I am sure that they never appear on the stage that night.

Moreover, there were several prices about the tickets and an available discount, Something that wasn't true. We didn't get any discount. Furthermore On your advertisement you say that visitors can visit the theatre restaurant after the play, but the restaurant was closed and I'd like to know why. I am very disappointed about the whole situation and I am not happy  to ask for a money refund.###Firstly I'd like to complain about the actors in the show. In your advertisement you say that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are starring in the play but I am sure that they never appeared on the stage that night. Secondly, another problem was about the starting time. According to your advertisement, the play starts at 19.30 but instead it started at 20:15, this is about almost an hour's delay. Moreover, there were several prices about the tickets and an available discount, something that wasn't true. We didn't get any discount.

Technology - along with science - has made huge steps and has turned into a growing monster which doesn't have an ending.

The simpliest example of modern high tech is the introduction of the computer - or better known as the P.C -. Reserches have shown that almost every single house owns a P.C. Some people use them for their job because they do need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun. Other examples that may not look like huge technological miracles are the T.V, the microwave, the video, the satelite dish, the cd player and hundreds of others. All thease play a serious role in our daily life with out us ever understanding it. All of us have turned into pathetic, technological, robots. Those things can and do make our lifes easier and more comfortable, but the call us away from our friends, our families and more over they lead us to madness and cut off any relantionship with everything that suround us and keep us in life.###The simplest example of modern high technology is the introduction of the computer - or better known as the PC -.

Modern technology has changed my daily life, making it easy, with less effort and time spent on .

Technology allows us to have more time to distractions or to other things we really like to do. We can take care of whom we love and give them more attention, time is not a really problem. We will see people differently, with more calm, because we have no stress and we are not in a hurry to do something else. We will be more comprehensible with others. It is the first step for a true fraternity.###Technology allows us to have more time for leisure or for other things we really like to do.

I have no idea from where to start. The main character of the musical show, which I'd like to say wasn't the "BEST", was awfull. His act was not good and he didn't seem like acting. Even my son could act better. After the horrible act of your star, it comes the starting ours. I was sitting and waiting for forty five minutes until the play started. You advertise that the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20:15, as it did. And then, when I arrived at the theatre, I expected to have a discount but unfortunatly I didn't. Among all these, the theatre restaurant was closed, because the shef and the waiters where on holiday. You could hire other staff to do the work. I was very dissappointed, what else can I write.

The first and most important thing is that modern technology have made our life easier, for instance the ricer cooker is a great invention, all you have to do is putting rice on it and switch it on, it makes cooking more effeciently. Furthmore, we can use the computer and telephone a lot. Wherever you are, you can get in touch with people whenever you want.###The first and most important thing is that modern technology has made our life easier, for instance the rice cooker is a great invention, all you have to do is put rice in it and switch it on, it makes cooking more efficiently.

Indeed, the modernism helps us to lead a confortable and better life than before. For example, cars, planes are a wonderful invention!

The communication has made many progresses too. Everyone gets a television at home. "A machine which talks and shows pictures!"

Although there are new machines etc, the health makes many discoverts thanks to the searching on different diseases in order to make the population lived older.###Communication has made many advances too.

However, nothing was further from what really happened. In the beginning, it was impossible to obtain any of the offered discounts, even though I presented an official ISIC card. Then, the audience had to wait 45 minutes over the announced timetable for the show to get started. And finally, when it went on, we realised that there was not Danny Brook performing, which was really disappointing.###However, nothing was further from what really happened.

TO THE MANAGER OF "THE CIRCLE THEATRE" AFTER FINISHING A STRESSFUL YEAR AT SCHOOL, I TOOK A SHORT HOLIDAY, WHOSE "SPLENDID ENDING" WAS A WEEK IN LONDON, WHILE I WAS THERE, I SAW A VERY ATTRACTIVE SIGN: THE "OVER THE RAINBOW" MUSICAL SHOW WAS BEING PLAYED AT YOUR THEATRE, MOREOVER, THE WONDERFUL DANNY BROOK WAS THE PROTAGONIST OF IT.

WE ASKED ABOUT "THE DISCOUNTS" THAT WERE OFFERED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT AND THE ONLY THING THAT THE LADY WHO WAS SELLING THE TICKETS COULD SAY WAS: WHAT DISCOUNTS? THEN, WE MOVED INSIDE THE THEATRE AND WE HAD TO WAIT 45 MINUTES UNTIL THE SHOW BEGAN!!, WHILE WE WERE WAITING, WE THOUGHT WE COULD GO TO THE RESTAURANT AFTER THE EVENT, AND THEN, WE REALIZED IT WAS CLOSED.

Two years ago in this school, Pat and I used to be best friends. We used to tell everything to each other. I was having some family problems, so my marks were getting down and down. Pat was worried, she didn't know what to do.

That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise.

Dear Sir or Madam, After I had read your advertisement I went to "the Circle Theatre" looking forward to watching your musical "Over the rainbow". In the end I was very disappointed. Firstly, the show did not start on time but fourty-five minutes later. This made me a little bit angry because I already had troubles with buying a ticket before: although it was proclaimed in the advertisement, there were no £15 and £10 discounts available. But I did not mind anymore because I knew that a show with Danny Brook would be worth this. That was why I was really shocked recognizing that there was another actor playing his role. This actor was not almost as brilliant as Danny Brook and I would not have paied so many money if I had known this before. At the end of the musical I decided to "rescue" this evening by visiting your theatre restaurant. Like everything else that had gone wrong that evening, the restaurant was closed because the cook had fallen ill! I hope you can see that this was no "perfect evening" and I was very disappointed, mostly because this was the last night of our stay in London. I am convinced I to have the right to get some money back from you because none of your promises was a carried out. Yours faithfully Gabe Grumman (Mrs)###Dear Sir or Madam, After I had read your advertisement I went to "the Circle Theatre" looking forward to watching your musical "Over the rainbow".

The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular: an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea, fighting with a strong fish he had caught. What makes the situation difficult is that none of the two characters wants to give up. It becomes a fight about life or death.###The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular: an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea, fighting with a strong fish he has caught.

The excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist. He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and the nature.

17th of June of 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing for complaining about different points which I am very disappointing with. I was to the theatre to see the musical show called 'Over the Rainbow'. There I was with many problems. first of all, I bought four tickets for £20 each and discounts were not available. Secondly, I arrived at the theatre at 9:15 because the start time was at 9:30. However, the show started at 20:15. I was fed up with to wait. The worst thing of all was that at the beggining of the show I realized that the actors were totally different from the ones advertised. They were worst than the previst actors. After the show, my friends and I were very furious in spite of that. We decided to go to the theatre restaurant to eat something and to relax. The surprise was that the restaurant was closed. I am absolutely annoyed. In my opinion, you have to give us back us money because everything what you wrote in your advertisement was not true. I hope to get your answer soon. Finally, I want to say you this is the last time which I come to your theatre. Thank you. Yours sincerely CAROLINA RODRIGEZ.###17th of June of 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing for to complain about various things which I am very disappointed with.

No one knew apart from me and my mother. I kept lying when somebody asked where my dad was. "He's travelling around the world," I would say, and everyone would admire him.

I was displeased from the very beginning, because I expected to get a discount as I'm a student. According to your advertisment I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all.

The show started t 20.15 instead of 19.30. I had to wait in the overcrowded hall. When finally the show had started I found out that Danny Brook was replaced by another actor. One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook's participance. So, you could understand how disappointed I was.###The show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30.

I bought the ticket for the evening performance to end the day with a nice musical. But the time wasn't kept. I had to wait 45mins to get in!

When I was buying a ticket, there was no discount. But in the newspaper it was wrote to be a discount. I paid £20 to the cashier. I was hungry and I thought I could eat something at the theatre restaurant after the show. But it was closed without any reason. It was very rude. For this, I want my money back. Because I didn't enjoy  at the theatre.###When I was buying a ticket, there was no discount. But in the newspaper there was said to be a discount. I paid £20 to the cashier.

And computers, are the most important product of technology. In the world, people spend the whole day by playing with computers. Not only as a hobby. They use computers for their works.

As I was spending a week-end in London. I took a chance too see the performance of one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook. Unfortunately as soon as I came to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore. Besides, since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we hadn't had any dinner, as we had been thinking of to have it at your restaurant. You cannot imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been posticipated at 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of restructuring; as a matter of fact, after the show we only ate an hamburger in a fast-food restaurant.###As I was spending a weekend in London.

First of all, the show is far away from being the best musical show in London. I was very exited to see it yesterday, but as soon as I arrived at the theater the problems began. I was looking forward on having a discount of some pounds on my ticket, as the leaflet says, however, it did not happen. After that, I became even more angry because, as far as I concerne, the show must begin on time, but it started forty five minutes late. Finally, the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but others I have never seeing before, and the restaurant was closed with no advise.###First of all, the show is far away from being the best musical show in London.

First of all, the play was supposed to start at 7:30 P.M. but it actually started only at 8:15 P.M. so I had to wait forty-five minutes.

When the play finally started, and the two actors entered the stage, I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook, differently from what the advertisement sign says, what really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play.###When the play finally started, and the two actors entered the stage, I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook, contrary to what the advertisement sign says, which really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play.

First of all, we all became much more sedentary than in the past. Most of the modern jobs involves computers, so there is no physical effort, just mental, but, on the other hand, we improved communications with computers and the Internet, a kind of communication where there is no need to meet personally, to see the other person, just the need to talk.###First of all, we have all become much more sedentary than in the past.

This show was for me very disappointing for many reasons: First of all, I was very surprised by the no presence of the famous actor, Danny Brook, who was one of my reasons for to book a sit. Also, I'm unhappy about the bad informations of your advertisement, which clearly says, the play begins at 19.30, instead of 20.15 as my evening' show. At the end of show, unfortunately for me and the others spectators, the worst thing happened: the theatre's restaurant was closed without any reasons being given and nobody went to us to apologise or advice us for an other restaurant opened late in the night.###This show was very disappointing for me for many reasons.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's why all his friends were angry against him and let him alone. It was clear that Pat had to change and show to his friend that they can believe in him thrutly. For those next few days, Pat will do his best to be the most sympathic as possible. To beginning, every morning Pat says a pleasant "hello" in adding to that a big smail. His mother always says: "If you are smailing and are nice with the people, the poeple would be nice and would smail to you". As Pat does always what his mother says his friends began to play again with him, but not just his old friends, every body wanted to play with me.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It didn't take long time until my embarrassing story was out in the open. I asked myself how I could be so stupied, telling her my secret after all I had been going through to keep it to myself. But now when the story was out, it was just to start to accept it. Maybe it wasn't so bad after all? All of a sudden I started to believe that this was the best solution of all. Now I didn't need to go around and worring about it anymore. At once I felt more assertive and a big smile appeared in my face. I decieded to thank Pat, and maybe, if possible, teach her a lession.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

Now I didn't need to go around and worrying about it anymore. At once I felt more assertive and a big smile appeared on my face. I decided to thank Pat, and maybe, if possible, teach her a lesson.
That evening I went to her house. I pretended to be totaly miserable. Pat didn't know what to do, she apoligised over and over again and I could really see that she was more than devestated. Finally I smiled. After huging eatch other we promised never to tell others about our secrets. Especially not if it has to do with failing all your exams....###That evening I went to her house.

Yesterday I went to "The Circle Theatre" to see the musical show "OVER THE RAINBOW". I'm very disappointed of this evening. The first thing was, that it started 45 minutes late.

First of all, why did the show began at 20:15, not at 19:30 as indicated in the advertisement. I waited quite one hour to see the show, and what happened with the actor? I came to that show only for see him and when the actor appear, it was another one. There is more! Where were the discounts that I should have earned? I was very disappointed with that! After the show my sun wanted to eat some biscuits and when I see the restaurant closed, I gave up, I told to my sun that we'll never come back here again.###First of all, why did the show begin at 20:15, not at 19:30 as indicated in the advertisement.

For me the most disappointing problem was that the starring Danny Brook wasn't there. My husband was also looking forward to seeing Mr. Brook as an actor of your musical because he is one of his greatest fans. The actor which acted instead of Danny Brook wasn't as good as Mr. Brook.###For me the most disappointing problem was that the star Danny Brook wasn't there.

After the show, which wasn't really the best I have ever seen, my family and I wanted to get some snacks in the theatre restaurant.

First of all, Danny Brook, an excellent actor, who (according to the play advertisement) was supposed to perform, was replaced for a disappointing actor. Besides that the spectacle was setted up to start at 19:30, but ended up starting at 20:15. In addition to all this, the promised discounts in the tickets was not offered. Finally, after the play the theatre restaurant was still closed. Sir, I couldn't believe in that, everything that was in the advertisement was a fraud.###First of all, Danny Brook, an excellent actor, who (according to the play advertisement) was supposed to perform, was replaced by a disappointing actor.

Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing that could ever happened in their lives. However, since I was a child I have noticed that, except for the medical facilities and achievements, it has brought to me more disadvantages than advantages. I still remember the day the television came to my house, I was only seven, everybody was exciting about the new "toy", however, what seemed to be only one more way to get together, turned out to rule our lives. Unfortunatly my parents did not realize how TV was creating a role among us. Before TV, we used to spend our nights, playing cards, telling jokes, talking to each other. Nowadays, I barely know my parents, but I do know exactly what is happening in the soap operas. On the other hand, due to science development, I am getting better, recovering from ahsma. In addition to this it is wonderful not have to wait too long to eat, thanks for the microwaves invention. Despite all these advantages, I deeply miss the times I had almost no technological facilities, but a very happy and united family.###Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing that has ever happened in their lives.

I had a vary dissappointing evining last saturday. I had everythig planned, I and my family where coming to whatch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disasterous. Firstly there was no available discount, as you said one on your advertisement, so even my 6 year old son was charged the adult price. Then everything was going well untill the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30 well it didn't, it started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15. And By the way may I ask you how up to date your leaflets are because in spite of the ad vert saying the staring actor was Danny Brook, well it wasn't. It was an other actor and one I had never heard of. That was a dissapointment for my whole family, infact all the viewers where very dissappointed.###I had a very disappointing evening last Saturday.

Anyway the show was nowhere as good as it was mentioned to be and it was definately worse than I had expected it to be, I didn't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress. So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes, desparately searching for your restaurants, our stomaches rumbling for food. Finally we found the place. The location is far too far away and, what do you know?, the place is closed for restoration, and it has been for two weeks! And your booking staff didn't know this obviously as they took our booking, with no problems whatsoever. they even gave us a table number.###Anyway the show was nowhere near as good as it was meant to be and it was definitely worse than I had expected it to be.

First of all, the advertisement for the shows provided absolutely WRONG information about the actors.

The clothes is part of each culture and one of these things which expresses our taste and personality. People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary, feel comfortable and stand out. They come up with many ideas but it can't last for a long time. Nowadays, it's getting obvious that designers sold only details, but significant changes don't turn up. Styles mix, colours and shapes come back from the past, and only the fabrics are different.###Clothes are part of each culture and one of those things which express our taste and personality.

People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time. Teenagers are bored with casual fashion and their parents laugh at them because of the fact they wear common clothes. That's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to omit the boredome. I am sure that at last we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free there won't be any problem with being up-do-date.###People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time.

Recently, we have had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives. My life has also changed as a result of modern technology. Thanks to computers, phones, mobile phones, and the internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to do before. My father is a sailor and I meet him only four times a year. But thanks to mobile phone I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. I also enjoy shopping through the internet. This way I don't have to do be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes. In the future I would love to be a doctor, especially a cardiologist. Nowadays, modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients.###Recently, we had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives.

However, I can see some disadvantages of technological progress. First of all, I spend too much time indoors playing on the computer or watching TV. I know that if I want to keep fit and stay healthy, I must take up some sport. Moreover, modern technology has made our environment more polluted. That's why we should abandon cars from city centres, and closed down factories which produce too much sewage. Although modern progress has made our life easier, it may be also harmful. We should all be aware of these consequences of modern technology and use it considerably.###However, I can see some disadvantages of technological progress.

Firstly, we were informed that Danny Brook was starring but a different actor was starring in the show and he was really disappointing. Secondly, in the advertisement it was written that the show was to start at 19:30. However, it started at 20:15, almost an hour late. Thirdly, it was written that discounts were available but we were again frustrated, seing they were not available. Finally, although we were informed that the theatre restaurant would be open after the show, it was closed because the show had started late.###Firstly, we were informed that Danny Brook was starring but a different actor was starring in the show and he was really disappointing.

As you can see, most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided. We did not have "a perfect evening" as it was written, actually we had an evening full of the theatre's mistakes and were extremely disappointed. I suppose it will be better for your theatre's reputation to give at least some of my money back.###As you can see, most of the offered activities in the advertisements were not provided.

If I were to talk about my own life, my speech would be simple: "My electronic alarm-clock wakes me up in the morning. I go to school by underground. When I come home, I cook my meal in the microwave. In my spare time, I watch television, play with my computer, or chat in the internet..." There is no sentence without electronic devices. I wonder what I could do without them... I don't go out with my friends or read books. I have friends in the internet and can learn anything while surfing in it. I sometimes get bored or feel isolated, because I know I am living in a virtual world.###If I were to talk about my own life, my speech would be simple: "My electronic alarm clock wakes me up in the morning.

At first the show started much later than it was written out. Instead of half past seven the show startet at quarter past eight. I couldn't go to have a refreshment because of two reasons, the first one is that there was no information about how much time the start of the show is going to be late by. The second reason is that the restaurant of the theatre was closed because of building plans for the next two month.###First the show started much later than it was advertised.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He didn't want to say what Sarah just had told him, it just came over of his mouth, when he talked to James. "Sarah has won in a quiz show?"

According to the advertisement, discounts should be available, but, in fact, I was refused to take the payment for tickets in this way. It was very uncamfortable for me. In addition to this, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was too late (the show did not start on time). Everybody, who came to it's doors, had to go to the other restaurant in a bad mood. I could have understood this if the musical show had been marvellous, but it was not even quite interesting.###According to the advertisement, discounts should have been available, but, in fact, I was refused a discount.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was a 25-years-old secretary in one big company. Her boss was a rich man, really rich. His name was Timson White. He was one of the most famous person in his city, but he wasn't honest with his clients. Pat had worked for him for two years. Certainly she knew a lot of secrets. One of them was about her boss' private life: he had got an illegal son.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She was a 25-year-old secretary in a big company.

Timson's wife, who was good looking and young, couldn't know about this, but one beautiful day she asked him how his son was and where he was at that moment. Timson was really shocked! He even couldn't say a word. He tried to make up who could give his wife knows. Of course, only one person had known this except his best friends. This was his secretary Pat, however, he couldn't be sure and decided to check it up.###Timson's wife, who was good-looking and young, couldn't know about this, but one beautiful day she asked him how his son was and where he was at that moment.

Next day, he understood that he was right. Timson had a row at home and also needed a new secretary. It was the worst weekends in a last few years. On the other hand, now everything is o.k.

The inventions of the airplane, of the train and of the car, have reduced the distances of the world, so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day. It means that daily life is faster and busier because I'm able to go to school in the morning and then to play soccer in the afternoon, and after a few minutes I can stay in the other side of Lecce to play piano with my musical band, then I can go back home when I want, listening to the notices about what happens around the world with the radio of my car.

First of all, I would like to indicate that you put the wrong starting and finishing hours. The Musical started at 20:15 not at 14:30 - as you have mentioned.

Try to imagine: the wide, colourful street with many fantastic cars and shinny large shops. Try to think about people in weird black and grey clothes on them.

People were wearing almost everything, during more than 2000 years of their living on Earth. Everything was changing: style, colour, qual. Fashion. Their clothes were always strictly connected with their lifestyle, climate and money. We saw almost all kinds of skirts, trousers, coats, skirts and even hats - which untill nowadays are the main point of many fashion creatures. What can we suspect then? What something new hasn't been invented for now? I say it to you - black and grey. These are two powerful colours, which will be expanding for the nearest 100 years.###People have been wearing almost everything, during more than 2000 years of their living on Earth.

The climate is changing, so we would have only two seasons. And we will need only two colours: grey for hot days and black for cold ones.

Showing their figure, they would have the possibility to show their sexuality. But, don't forget, any exhibitionism! We have too many taken off people around us, now. And it will be a thing of the past. Streets of the 21st century will be smart.###The climate is changing, so we will have only two seasons.

First of all, when I bought the tickets I had no discount, and in the advertisement it was mentioned that people would have some, and when I got in the theatre to see the play, I had to wait for almost an hour until the show begun. Then, I got very disappointed because the actors in the play were not those ones mentioned in the advertisement. There were unknown actors, and they were not as good as the other ones. Afterwards, I was expecting to have at least a nice dinner in the theatre restaurant, but it was already closed because the show ended too late.###First of all, when I bought the tickets I got no discount, and in the advertisement it was stated that people would get some, and when I got into the theatre to see the play, I had to wait for almost an hour until the show begun.

The Internet is certainly the most evident of all these innovations. Information is spread quickly and you can access in minutes a wide range of data, that would take a much longer time if it had to be found by traditional means. For a shy person, like me, the Internet has another attractive: the possibility of knowing people and making friends worldwide. It's very exciting. Currently, I exchange e-mails with dozens of people all over the country.###The Internet is certainly the most obvious of all these innovations.

I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to have a discount as I was a student. However, the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had been sold out. I could not understand why but I still bought the ticket because I was crazy about Danny Brook. Then, I went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry for waiting until 20:15, forty-five minutes after the expected starting time. Furthermore, I was so disappointed to find out that Danny Brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so bad that I left the theatre before it finished. At last, I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it needed cleaning.###I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to get a discount as I was a student.

A week later, when I was still in a bad mood, my form teacher, Mrs Brown, talked about jobs in our English lesson. She told us there were numerous types of job in the world. Some offered a high salary while some did not. However, they are equal important for our society. 'Who wants to be a doctor?' She asked. Many students raised their hands. 'Who wants to be a lawyer?' Again, many students put up their hand. But when she asked who wanted to be a cleaner, nobody raised his hand and I felt so shameful that I lowered my head. 'Cleaner is a very good job.' Mrs Brown said with a loud voice. 'If there were no cleaner, who would clean the school for us, who would keep the environment nice and tidy.' Suddenly, all the classmates applauded and smiled to me with respect. The teacher also grinned and I was so impressed and repeated the words in my heart: 'All the jobs have the same importance.'###A week later, when I was still in a bad mood, my form teacher, Mrs Brown, talked about jobs in our English lesson.

But all was disappointing! First, as I am very found of Danny Brook, I have been surprised that he totally changed his voice, face, and so on! It was not Danny on the scene!

"How has modern technology changed your daily life?" First of all, "daily life" concerns (as far as I am concerned) my life everywhere, and more precisely at home, at the university and at work. Up to two years ago, I was working with a written booknote or agenda, and I used to phone with a wired phone system. Nowaday, I organise my activities with an electronic organizer that authorizes me to connect to the Internet by infra-red link with my mobile phone to get informations and electronic mails. I am always joinable with my mobile phone, that is also sometimes boring! Being in an apprenticeship, I go to both work and university. At the university, I have learned with computer aided systems. I often go on the Internet to find informations for studying a precise subject more accutely (university technology sites).

Last Saturday I went to see "Over the Rainbow". When I read the advertisement, I noticed that Danny Brook acted in this musical show. I appreciated him a lot. When the show started forty-five minutes later, I realised that the main actor had been changed. That change really disappointed me. Another problem was that I didn't have any discount, and I wasn't alone, we were five persons. Our idea after the show, was to visit the theatre restaurant, but it was closed. Nobody could give me an answer. I really had an awful evening.###Last Saturday I went to see "Over the Rainbow". When I read the advertisement, I noticed that Danny Brook acted in this musical show.

I grew up in a world with full of technology and for me the recent development in the technology is not very big. Of course, it changes, it became normal to have a mobile phone or to use mainly the computer and the internet. It becomes more and more easier to use the computer for everything. You don't have to go to the shop to buy clothes or to the restaurant to order some food. I can just switch on my computer and order everything.

However, things re recycling from time to time. So do the objective of wearing clothes.

The people in the past wear clothes to protect themselves from the cold air, hot weather and strong wind. On the other hand, the people in the future will propably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and water, the harmful ultra-violet rays from the sun and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which is the result of a developed and full-grown country.###However, things are recycled from time to time.

I think people in the future will likely to wear helmets with oxygen gas well provided. It is because of the increasing number of the population and the shortage of the oxygen gas in the atmosphere. They will also wear water-proof, ultra-violet proof and other dangerous liquid-proof clothes to protect themselves. These clothes have to be made of something light, suitable to wear and protective.

Like I have already told you, instead of being the perfect evening, it was the worst I ever had. First, the actors that the Circle theatre publis in their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because, the actors were starring in the musical, was one of it mayor attractions. Another point that I want to comply about, is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was a mayor unsatisfaction about it, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered that your food was unhealthy, and I am not considering many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.###As I have already told you, instead of being the perfect evening, it was the worst I ever had.

Answering the question: "How has modern technology changed my daily life?", I can confirm, that it has been in many ways, and the most important one that I can remember was the invention of computers and later the internet, because it was easiest to me, and to every one, to make your home works, school works, and, in fact, it was easier to me to search for information that in the past I would have to look at in a library.

Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show I went to see last Wednesday. I was told I would have the most perfect evening in London, but it was not. When I bought my ticket I expected to be able to take advantage of those discounts you announced in the newspaper advertisement but when I had to pay the most expensive price. I went to see the performance at 19:30 but it did not start until 20:15! I was really angry but I wanted to see Danny Brook. My surprise was when, instead of Mr. Brook, a different actor appeared on stage. At the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but when I arrived I realized it was closed because the musical show had finished too late! All I am asking for is a full refund of the money I spent in the musical. I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Sir or Madam, With reference to your advertisment regarding the musical show "Over the rainbow" I am writing to you with the intention of to give you an impression of our experiences visiting the above mentioned show. We were disappointed to realize that not Danny Brook but a different actor played one of the main characters. Honestly it was a less impressive performance than we had expected. According to your advertisment the play should have started at 19:30. Unfortunately there was an unexplained delay of 45 minutes. The audience had to sit and wait until 20:15. What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given; not even an apologation. We had been told that discounts to the ticket-prices were possible but at the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered. After the show we had intended to visit your theatre restaurant, which was - to our surprise - closed because of the time delay! So we had to leave hungry and with a certain feeling of frustration and disappointment. Honestly for us it was not that "perfect evening out". We would like to ask you if there is any chance of to get our money back of or if you can offer any other alternative for our convenience? We are looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully M. S.###Dear Sir or Madam, With reference to your advertisement regarding the musical show "Over the rainbow" I am writing to you with the intention of giving you an impression of our experiences attending the above-mentioned show.

I'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where "The old man and the Sea" by Earnest Hemingway will be read. I recommend you listen to it! As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us. I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us? Therefore Hemingway is a very good example. He fought in the Spanish Civil war and in World War II was always on the search for answers to questions like "... what defines a man", or "... what happens to us in critical situations". These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books. One of the most interesting ones is "The old man and the Sea". A story of an old seaman leaving his town to proove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught. The story describes his feelings, thoughts, fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish. In the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to "sacrifice" his fish to attacking sharks. So did he finally win or loose? An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway's work and what he meant by "pace under pressure".###I'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where "The old man and the Sea" by Earnest Hemingway will be read.

What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This question is not simple to answer. On the one hand, science and technology have been developing rapidly, and God knows what new materials will be invented in the future. We probably will be wearing dresses made of synthetic artificial cloth in 2100. Of course, those new material won't be so harmful for our health as today's nylon and other things like that.###What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This question is not simple to answer.

There are a lot of new modern technologies around the world, which appear not long ago. Among them, a mobile telephone, computers, telefaxes, different mashiens for the kitchen, mashiens which helps housekeeper to do any work about the house. All of them play a very great role in people's daily life. The first change is that they very simplify the life of people.

They can only push on their dish mashiensdishwashers and go to do something what they think more pleasant. So with the appearance of new morden technology people have got much more free time.

I believe, living in a modern country, that science and technology affected any aspect of my daily life. Looking back in the past, I can see, how big a difference there is between the life of my grandparents and mine. People living in the past couldn't travel so far as we could now and couldn't express the news around the world as we do it now, at present days. They could not communicate with someone living in other country, often located far away from his own. Using mobile phones, e-mails or the internet, we have a better access to a lot of different news.###I believe, living in a modern country, that science and technology affect every aspect of my daily life.

So, we are in a better situation now. But there are some drawbacks, which appeared in last years. For example, a lot of pollution has raised. We now breathe worse air in our lungs, then our grand-parents breathed. I think, we are more addicted to do some things, which are not concerned with human nature. For example, people are addicted today to watch TV or often using the mobile phones. I don't really mind them. But I think and strongly believe, that we are the part of wildlife. And the modern technology that we use in our everyday life might not only help us, but determinly might destroy us.###So, we are in a better situation now.

At the end, I would like to say that my evening out two days before was not perfect and I wold be glad if you could pay my some money back.###Finally, I would like to say that my evening out two days ago was not perfect and I would be glad if you could give.

Radio, television, stereo, CD, computer: it's hard to believe, but every day I'm using something that was borns from the technology.

But they can also have a bad influence on people's mind. Since I went to school, I've seen my way of thinking has changed: in my mind all must be in order like in a CD-rom of a computer. It's incredible but if I think of the key-word of the mind, the only one I can think of is ORDER. Then there are television, radio, stereo: another bad aspect is that every day, consciousness, I'm using these instruments. They are objects which take part of my life. In the afternoon I stay two hours listening to the radio or watching television instead of going to the city centre: it seems I prefer staying with objects without an aim and that can't speak with me, in orderrar than to meet new people, to speak with them and to have a contact with the "human world".

I think modern technology has changed human's life a lot, expecially starting with the last century. The changements brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or with a part of it. In my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity to get out: I live on a little mountain at 160 metres of altitud so I cannot go to the city using a bycicle. Because of my "isolation" the telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and the internet so study or do researches, because there are not any book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town. Moreover without a cellular phone my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city because it is too far and she is worried. Another thing that I appreciate a lot is the electric guitar; I like very much play guitar, and in my free time I prefer play electric, than acoustic or classic guitar, using distortion and gain and the highest volume possible.###I think modern technology has changed mankind's life a lot, especially since last century.

Firstly, the advertisement told that Danny Brook was going to starr in a musical but it turned out to be a completely different person, which was very disappointing. It was very unprofessional of you to had printed a wrong starring name on the paper. Secondly, according to the advertisment, the musical was supprsed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15, which caused me a trouble. As for my ticket, I was expecting to get a discount as a student, as it said so in the advertisement, however, it was not actually available, which was very disappointing again. Then, I was hoping to have a meal at the theatre restaurant, which was recommended in the advertisement, however, it was not possible for me to do so as the restaurant was closed due to the stuff vacation, which I thought was very unprofessional.###Firstly, the advertisement said that Danny Brook was going to star in the musical but it turned out to be a completely different person, which was very disappointing.

Firstly, I hoped to have a relaxing entertainment with your musical show but it was not the case. In your advertisement you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. They were replaced by less famous actors. Unfortunately, the musical show was annoying. I was terribly disappointed. Moreover, it started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 as you had written on it. I had to wait for 45 minutes without nothing doing. I would you informed us before.###Firstly, I hoped to have a relaxing evening at your musical show but that didn't happen.

First of all, as you also know, lots of technology have boosted since a few years. For example, without using the internet I could not put me through to foreign people. This interactive way of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere without restrictions. I feel free as a eagle. I can take advantage of those technologies as mobile phone, lap top computer, television, to have contacts with different cultures.###First of all, as you also know, lots of technology has advanced in a few years.

Secondly, technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do much more things than before. Unfortunately, it could have an inconvenient for me because of pollution from cars, factories. I can't go to the towncentre of a big city.

Firsty, the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later. I paid for this performance the full price of £20 because discounts were not available although on your advertisement there were. And the biggest disappointment for me was that the grateful Danny Brook, the best singer in London, wasn't present and it was singing a mother unknown person. And last but not least, I recognised after the show that your theatre restaurant was closed because waiters didn't come...###Firstly, the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later.

I don't know whether it is a typical situation in the Circle Theatrer that it is promised much more then the people can get for their money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but I am not agree with such a situation and would ask you for my money back - my bank account number is enclosed.

First of all it changed our life-style. For example, ten years ago it was very common that almost all people visited cinemas and today they prefer watching films at home because they have relatively good video-recorders and TV. Because the people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobil and can spend their free-time more aktiv - they can often visit their friends and travel much more. People today are more open for the world.###First of all it changed our lifestyle.

Secondely, we can do our jobs today more efficient. We have modern equipment for communication - phones, faxes, E-mail. We can communicate with our partner faster and better and offer them better service. The ordered goods can be deliver in a shorter time by train, trucks and modern ships. If we are more efficient we can earn more money and spend it more for our daily life - for better clothes, furniture, spare time.###Secondly, we can do our jobs today more efficiently.

The problem is that there was some differences between the advertisement and the show I've seen. First, Danny Brook wasn't the star that night, he was replaced by an actor that seemed like a rookie. Another problem, the show started at 20:15 in the place of 19:30 and when it finished I couldn't have a dinner because the theatre's restaurant was closed (it closes at 22:00). Moreover, there wasn't any discounts availables (I'm a student but I paid for a full ticket).###The problem is that there were some differences between the advertisement and the show I saw.

Last weekend we diced to go to the bach with Pat and Nick (her boyfriend). When we arrived there Eingrid and Pat decided to take a sunbath while I and Nik walked in the sand.

We had a little conversation and suddenly she kissed me, but I refused to continue.

How has modern technology changed your daily life? The entrance in to the new millennium brought us a lot of changes. Many things have been replaced by the others which are more helpful and useful. The most important thing for me is using a computer. The main adventage is that, it provides you with all the informations that you need. For example, you have to write an Essay about the 2-nd world war. You get into the internet and you're looking for those facts and informations which will help you to do your homework. Searching in the computer's memory takes about 1 minute so it is very fast. Further more you can play with the computer, and unfortunetly this advantage has especially changed my life.###How has modern technology changed your daily life?

The next thing that has changed my life is a mobile telephone. This little thing brings a lot of satisfaction. It is very useful either. I have got a steady contact with my parents and friends. I have no problems with changing the time of a meeting because I can always phone. But actually it is boring when you're almost always under observation.

I only press the button and everything is going alright.###The next thing that has changed my life is a mobile telephone. This little thing brings a lot of satisfaction. It is very useful too.

I would like to add that, being a student, I find discounts very important for my budget. Also, without any reason being given they were not available.
I will be gladfull if you will send my money back.###I will be glad if you will send my money back.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This was the reason whe we were in horrible troubles with the police.

Let's go back to the beginig of this story. I with my friends had a holidays and decided to spend a few days on a "island". We called this place like this, because it was a piece of land in the middle of our lake. We tried to survive there without returning on a land - to our town. There was no light during nights so we had to find some wood to make a fire. I was a walking with my friend Pat in a forest when we discovered a gold. This is no joke! There was a secret place when a robber keept stolen gold from a bank. We found the solution of this deceperous situation - to say nothing to anybody. So we tried to keep our secret for 2 days but...###Let's go back to the beginning of this story. I and my friends had a holiday and decided to spend a few days on an "island".

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told him my worst love story. One day, I was going to school by bus and - I don't know why - I went to the end of it. I looked up and I saw her, standing next to me with her friend. Every time when I looked up at her my legs were shaking so I couldn't come up and talk to her! But with help from my friend, who convinced me to do this, I've met her. Her name was Sue and she was so beautiful that I still can't find words which could be good to describe her. I was constantly seeing her but my shyness made my mouth close so I couldn't say anything! I was in Love but that wasn't nice. Few days later someone told me that Sue was actually a boy! That was supposed to be a joke from my "coleagues"! From that moment I feel like I have been in front of a video camera and the operator of it is me! I couldn't speak to anyone. The worst thing in this story is, that Pat told this to everyone at school. From that moment I live alone. Thanks to Pat.###Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

The problems started at the beginning. Although it was written 19.30 in the advertisement, the play began at 20.15. In addition, a different actor was starring instead of Danny Brooks and this was the most disappointing thing that evening for me and my friends.###The problems started at the beginning.

From the time she began the university, the problems began. She was telling the secrets of her friends to the others. One day, her friends got fed up with this and ended their friendship. Pam was sorry but there was nothing she could do about this.###From the time she began the university, the problems began. She was telling the secrets of her friends to the others.

I'm a tourist and I had a week's holiday in London a few time ago. I had enjoied to see the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented some night ago; and the actor's Danny Brook performance. I went to the theatre at 19.30 o'clock but, with my surprise, the show started at 20:15 and so I couldn't remain here until the end because I had left London, with my group before the end of the show. The star, the actor Danny Brook, there wasn't in the musical show but there was an other actor, with my great disappoint.###I'm a tourist and I had a week's holiday in London some time ago.

Peter and Sue asked to Francis for some help for their exam's subjets and Francis, for to help them, was very busy all the week. The last day all the friends went to Pat's home with food, musical instruments, and a tape recorder. Pat was very excited about this.

First of all, Danny Brook was not starring and was replaced by a different actor. That was very disappointing. The performance started fourty five minutes later.

According to the advertisement, I could visit it after the show, but it was closed because of the lack of customers.###Furthermore, I would not be complaining if the theatre restaurant had been open.

Personally I feel the greatest influence from the side of personal computers. Their popularity could be explained by their comfort and easy use. With the help of the "Internet" it is possible to get much objective and useful information you are interested in. Computers take up the major part of my free time and this is the reason of disagreements between me and my parents. They would like me to go for a walk more often or to help them in their daily routine. I am completely satisfied with the way I spend my freetime, but they have another opinion.###Personally I feel the greatest influence from the side of personal computers.

First of all I recommend you to go on the 8 a.m. boat. It might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip. In my opinion a guided tour is essential, because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all the questions.###First of all I recommend you go on the 8 a.m. boat.

TV - a powerful force that keeps us glued to itself for endless hours every day, unable to press the "Off" button on the remote control. Some say it's evil, it spoils our eyes and personality, others say it's useful, enriches our minds with knowledge and helps teens form their individuality. But can each one of these people answer one simple question! "Could you live without television for a week?"###TV - a powerful force that keeps us glued to it for endless hours every day, unable to press the "Off" button on the remote control.

I can honestly say: I could. I like TV, I watch it but luckily I haven't become a TV addict yet. Well, maybe only yet. When do we turn on our TV set? When we are bored and lonely or on the contrary when we are tired of doing something we dislike. So if I lived without television for a week I'd find something else to keep me busy: invite some friends around, read a good interesting book, go bowling or to a swimming pool. This summer I lived for three weeks in a complete TV vacuum, I forgot it had ever existed. I just didn't have time for it, didn't allow it to enter my life. And no, it wasn't a self-made torture. I was just having a good time and I didn't need television to support me and keep me company in the dark summer evenings.###I can honestly say: I could.

The biggest difference the absence of TV had made in my life was that I actually started living. I think everyone can say "no" to TV because humans' will is far more stronger than the invisible hands that lure us into their cave. And it'll be good for you as well, after a week without TV you'll begin to appritiate it and your life a lot more.###The biggest difference the absence of TV made in my life was that I actually started living.

However, students who never have time for a healthy diet full of minerals, vitamins or fibre usually finish on "McDonalds", hamburgers or Bic Macs. Moreover, very often the school canteen doesn't offer diversified types of food, like different kinds of bread or salads. Usually we don't eat regularly and in good proportions. Our grandparents always remembered the value and quality of food. They found time to eat something hot for dinner - the main meal - and even if the times were worse, people were more sensible.###However, students who never have time for a healthy diet full of minerals, vitamins and fibre usually finish on "McDonalds" and hamburgers or Big Macs.
